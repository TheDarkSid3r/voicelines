Thanks for firing up a game of Drawful…^6.\\tWhat’s up? Welcome to Drawful…^1.\\tI see there are three of you. Small but mighty. That means you’ll each get to draw three times. ^2.\\tJust three players, huh? Well, the upside of not having many friends is that you’ll each get to draw more times.^3.\\tOh great. There are just three of you. You’ll get to do three drawings each, so… don’t screw this up.^4.\\tThree players? That means three full rounds of drawing.^5.\\tWow. Three player game? I like it. Everybody will get three shots at drawing something not terrible.^6.\\tThree players. Three drawings each. Bing bang boom.^1.\\tOne two three… four players. Great. You’ll each get to draw twice.^2.\\tOkay, since there appear to be four of you, we’ll go twice around, everybody getting to do two drawings.^3.\\tAaaannd… there are four of you playng, so let’s do two rounds of drawing. Easy as that.^4.\\tOnly four players? No problem. You’ll each get to draw twice.^5.\\tSo, everyone’s going to get to draw twice, which should work perfectly since there’s only four of you playing.^6.\\tIt looks like there are four of you playing. And I’m underwhelmed by your efforts so far, but maybe you’ll get better over these next two rounds.^1.\\tI see we have five players. Perfect for a two round game.^2.\\tSince there are five of you playing, I’m going to have you each draw twice.^3.\\tIt looks like we have five… ahem… excellent artists playing, so I’m going to give you each two chances to draw this game.^4.\\tOkay, we have…what? Five of you? That’s the perfect amount for two rounds of drawing.^5.\\tUnless my math is wrong, there are five of you. So… let’s give you each two opportunities to draw something really stupid.^6.\\tFive player game? Good. Good. I’ll let you each draw twice this time. BUT NO MORE!^1.\\tI see we’ve got a seven player game. You couldn’t talk one more player into joining? Oh well.^2.\\tThere are seven of you, I see. The more, the better, I say.^3.\\tPreparing a seven player game. There are seven of you, right? Yep.^4.\\tOkay, looks like we’ve got a four player game. % I’m just messing with you. I know there are seven of you.^5.\\tSeven players, ready to go.^6.\\tSeven players, one drawing each… seven picture game… yep, the math adds up.^Let’s see, we’ve got six players. Buckle up and get ready for two rounds of drawing.^2.\\tI was hoping this would be a six player game and lo and behold it is. You’re each going to get to draw twice.^3.\\tYeah, I see all six of you there. It makes for a slightly longer game, but I’m going to give each of you a chance to draw twice.^4.\\tOkay, what have we got here? Six players. Not bad. You’re each going to draw twice this game.^5.\\tSix players… check. The right amount for two rounds of drawing… check.^6.\\tSix players, huh? It’s like a little party in here. A party where everybody gets to draw twice.^1.\\tWow. Eight player game. Full house. I love it.^2.\\tI’ve gotta say… I’m pretty excited that there are eight of you playing.^3.\\tLooks like there are eight of you. I’m impressed. I can never lure seven people over to my house.^4.\\tWell well well… eight players. ^5.\\tI see there are eight of you. I hope you’re excited to look at a lot of stupid drawings.^6.\\tEight players, huh?

Just kidding. I got \\'em all.^Alright, all your pictures are in. Oh man, I can\\'t wait for you to see them. So, let\\'s not wait!^Okay, weirdos, let\\'s take a look at your artwork.^I bet some of you are a little nervous because we are about to all look at your weird weird drawings.^I have your drawings, and I know what to do with them.^It’s hard to know who’s to blame for everybody getting this one wrong.^No correct guesses. Ooo. That hurts.^Everybody was just way off on this one.^Hmmm. NO ONE got that one right. Awkward.^Nobody? Nobody got that one? Well okay then.^Well, I thought it was obvious. I guess I was the only one.^Oof! Everyone got that one wrong. ^You\\'re all wrong! Everybody\\'s wrong!^Total failure by everybody.^Even I would have gotten that one wrong.^Everyone messed up. Walk it off. Walk it off.^Ooo. Only one person got it wrong. That’s gotta hurt.^You all got it right! Well… most of you.^I kind of love it when everyone gets it right, expect for that one person that totally messed up.^And now let\\'s all laugh at the one person who got this wrong.^And one lone player... got it wrong.^Everybody gets points... except for one of you.^That was a big win for pretty much everybody.^And sometimes… everybody gets it right.^Yeah yeah yeah… you all got it right. Don’t get big heads about it.^Wow. Everybody got that one. I guess we’re going to have to make these harder.^Huh. I didn’t expect EVERYBODY to get that one right.^BOOM! Everybody got it right!^I don\\'t like it when EVERYBODY gets it right, but I\\'m a petty person.^And no one got it wrong.^Maybe you\\'re all too good at this game.^It’s fun when only one person gets it right, because they get to gloat.^Only one of you got that?! I expected more of you.^Only one of you didn’t mess that one up.^Congrats to the ONE player who got that one right.^Only one of you was able to figure that one out.^You were all so confident and all so wrong.^You know that expression, “Great minds think alike?” This was like that only with stupid minds.^It’s weird when everyone’s wrong in the exact same way.^Well, somebody’s leaving this round with ALL the points.^Oh no. Everybody got that one wrong.  EVERYBODY!^Let\\'s all just smile and be cool and hope no one notices that EVERYONE GOT THAT ONE WRONG!^Okay, I’m sending out another round of titles for everybody to draw.^Another batch of titles are heading to your devices as I speak. Get ready to draw them.^Everybody gets to draw again. The titles should be on your devices now.^That was so much fun, let’s do it again. Here are some more titles to draw.^Okay, get ready to draw again. The new titles should be on your devices now.^Well, that was fun.^Good stuff. Good good stuff.^Good effort everybody!^Okay. Well, that was that.^Okay. So… THAT happened.^I’m not sure how to feel about all of you.^I’m learning so much about your weird weird minds.^I like this group of players. I don’t know why… I just do.^I should probably be saving these drawings or something.^Alright. Well, we’re done with that now.^I’m just glad that we all got to share this moment.^I don’t know what to say about that one, so I won’t say anything.^Aaaaaaannnnd… we’re done with this one.^I might try to forget any of this ever happened.^Well, let\\'s not waste any more time on THIS one.^Are we done with this one? I think we\\'re done with this one.^Does anyone pay attention to the things I say here before going to the score tallys? I don\\'t think they do.^You\\'re a weird bunch of players.^We should make t-shirts out of some of these.^Okay, one last batch of drawing titles heading to your devices now.^Let’s do this drawing thing one last time.^You all get to draw one more time. Look to your devices for your new titles.^DrawingTimeLoop^Nobody finished a picture in time? NOBODY?! We can’t… play if no one draws anything. Okay… I’m sending everyone new titles. We’re going to try this again.^[long sighed ugh] No drawings got sent in time. That’s the WORST! We can’t play without them. Well, we have no choice but to try this again. I’m sending everybody new titles to their devices. Let’s do this!^Uh oh. Looks like one of you didn’t get your drawing in on time. That’s too bad… but, I won’t lose any sleep over it.^And it looks like one of you couldn’t finish your drawing before the time ran out. You gotta be faster next time. ^THIS time… let’s try to have EVERYONE get their drawing in… okay?^Hold on, hold on… only ONE of you finished your picture in time? That’s kind of crazy. But I refuse to throw that picture out, so we’re still going to do it. We’re doing the picture! ^Um… so… only one of you sent your picture in in time. That’s… awkward. Well, I guess we’ll just do that one picture then. ^It looks like some of you didn’t get your pictures in in time. That’s kind of annoying, but IT HAPPENS! We’ll just play with what we’ve got.^Not all of you bothered to send in a picture in time. Wow. Okay.

[category=host]^All hands on deck... and put them together in a clapping motion to welcome back our comics!  [category=host]^ Get ready to go 20,000 laughs under the sea with some more comedy!  [category=host]^Must be high tide because we are reaching the height of hilarity!  Let\\'s bring our comics back to the stage!  [category=host]^These comics know the ropes so how can I KNOT have them back?  K-N-O-T.  Knot. Get up here you goofs! [category=host]^How\\'s everyone feeling?! Good. As for me, my gout is acting up. No joke there. Just being vulnerable. Ok, here\\'s our next set of comedians! [category=host]^Now it\\'s time for some crowd work. You, sir, you look like crap!  Let\\'s bring the comics back out!  [category=host]^Let\\'s keep that energy going (out of breath) for our next comedian.   [category=host]^I hope you\\'re not sick of seeing these performers because here they are again! [category=host]^Buckle in, folks, because we\\'ve got another round of this. [category=host]^Remember, folks, it could be worse. You could be watching an improv show. Whoosh! [category=host]^Who\\'s worth saving when the ship capsizes? Let\\'s find out! [category=host]^It\\'s time to sink or swim, meaning, the winner gets a life vest and the rest of you, well... let\\'s see those scores!  [category=host]^Ok!  Which comedian is leaving with me in the life boat?  Let\\'s find out who deserves it the most!  [category=host]^I can only take one of you to safety, and obviously it should be the funniest person.  [category=host]^Let\\'s find out the winner of this beee-uuuu-tiful and fully functioning life vest!  [category=host]^Only one of you can get a life vest. [category=host]^Let\\'s see who\\'s won a trip with me off this sinking montrosity! [category=host]^Who comes out on top in this survival of the funniest?

Before we jump into the jokes, let’s do a little writing exercise to get inspired.  [category=host]^If another player uses one of your topics in a winning joke, you’ll get some bonus points. [category=host]^On your device you’ll be prompted to write various topics, like animals, people, or objects. Fill in whatever you think has a lot of comedic potential. [category=host]^Generate as many as you can. You have 45 seconds. Starting… NOW! [category=host]^Well, we\\'re sinking again! There\\'s no time to write jokes from scratch. [category=host]^So here\\'s the plan: let\\'s rewrite another comic\\'s joke. [category=host]^You’ll use the same set-up but will attempt to write a funnier punchline! The better the original joke did, the more points you’ll earn for beating it! [category=host]^Can you steal the spotlight before the boat sinks? Let’s find out! [category=host]^What do you think? Does this joke beat the original? [category=host]^Did they successfully punch up this joke? Vote now! [category=host]^Wow, a real clash of the titans! [category=host]^Which punchline is better?  [category=host]^Vote for your favorite punchline!  [category=host]^Which version do you like best?  [category=host]^Ok, let\\'s get to it. You know the drill! [category=host]^Yada yada, moving on! [category=host]^This writing exercise is ending soon! [category=host]^Ok, time to wrap things up. [category=host]^Just like my premium cable bundle, this writing exercise is ending soon! [category=host]^You\\'ve got time for one or two more. [category=host]^Get what you can in. We\\'ll be moving on soon. [category=host]^MUSIC/WriteLoop2^There\\'s still plenty of time to get in those lifeboats, folks, so let\\'s welcome our comics back one more time! [category=host]^Let\\'s turn those screams into laughs and welcome our comics back to the stage one last time! [category=host]^Please stay calm and welcome our comics back to the stage! [category=host]^The real tragedy would be not finishing the show. So let\\'s bring back our comics back! [category=host]^The comedy is still going down, just like the ship! Let\\'s hear it one last time for our performers!  [category=host]^We do have an official evacuation procedure... that we will tell you after we bring our comics back one more time!  [category=host]^Please leave your personal belongings behind but bring your laughter back for our performers! [category=host]^Well, we promised an evening of Titanic proportions, sorry about that. So let\\'s welcome back our comics!  [category=host]^Please hold onto each other for safety and at the same time welcome back our comics!

It should correspond with the second number spinning. [Updated 4.7.15 with -6dB quieter SFX] {Updated 4.16.15 with another -6dB reduction.]^This file plays when a card with a player’s answer zooms in to full screen.

(each player’s vote will have its own sound.)^This file plays when the SIXTH player’s vote pops onto the talk bubble for which that player voted. (each player’s vote will have its own sound.)^This file plays when the THIRD player’s vote pops onto the talk bubble for which that player voted.

The start of the SFX corresponds to the first frame of the percent meters coming onscreen.

(This is only for cards 2 - 8. There is a separate SFX for the first card that includes the sound of the board grid moving.)^This is the SFX for “All Votes In,” when the TIMER zips away. (I used to have it attached to the vote loops, but that didn’t work out. So now, when the timer goes away, and it hasn’t run out yet, this is the SFX to use.)^This file plays when a player has NO ANSWER on their card/talk balloon. So, in a pairing, on player has their response and the other’s says “No Answer.”^This file plays when a player, in a head-to-head situation, only receives ONE vote from another player. (e.g. In a 6 player game, one player gets 5 votes and the other only gets one.) This probably wouldn’t be used in a 3 player game.

There will be a “monster voice” that will play concurrently with this SFX (they’ll be delivered separately).^This file plays during ROUND ONE, ROUND TWO and ROUND THREE openings, when the number falls out of the “0.”^This file plays during gameplay when a player gets a “Quiplash” and the QUIPLASH stamp slams onscreen. (This has been updated 4.14.15)^This file plays during Gameplay when two players type in the exact same thing and the JINX stamp slams onscreen.^This file plays during Gameplay if  the timer runs all the way down.^This file plays when the black PERCENTAGE circle flies up and then down into the monsters’ mouth(s) (works for both Round 1 and Round 2). There will be an additional “monster eating” SFX that will play simultaneously.^This file plays during Round One/Two intros when the subtext flies offscreen (the lines of text beneath “Round One” or “Round Two” that explain the points).^This file plays during Round One/Two intros when the subtext flies ONSCREEN (the lines of text beneath “Round One” or “Round Two” that explain the points).^This is the sound when each player appears on the scoreboard, in front of their respective number.^This file should play any time there’s a “+ $$$” graphic that comes onscreen (e.g. “+500). For now, do it for ALL plus cash moments. We’ll see if it works.^This file plays when a player gets a QUIPLASH and their talk balloon knocks the other offscreen (this used to be QUIPSFX22 but I’m cutting that up into smaller pieces).^This file plays after all players have entered their answers (any round), the clock stops and the SCENERY around the border whooshes away.^Oooooohkay, I guess no one wants to play anymore. Fine. Bye!^Well, I do love the sound of crickets, but not this much. Bye!^Well, I haven’t felt this ignored since my weding night. I guess I’ll go to the bathroom and cry again. Bye.^Helloooooo? HELLOOOOOOOOOOOO??!! Okay, goodbye.^Hmm, interesting. Very minimalist. I like it. Hey, here’s some minimalism for you...^Well, this is fascinating what with the silence and all, but... I have to wash my hair. Bye.^I love you. Even though you’ve done this to me, I still love you. And sometimes, love means having to say goodbye. Goodbye.^(Hit microphone with hand) Is this thing on? Hello? Must not be on. Well, since no one’s listening, I’ll say it. I’m moving to Denver. I haven’t told anyone officially yet but it feels good to get of my chest. Denver, here I come! ^This file plays during the SCORING section and coincides with the small, black circle, that contains the percentages, comes onscreen. This was previously part of a larger SFX but that file has been cut up into smaller files to match up to animations better.^This is an updated SFX for the moment when the percentages inside the small black circle, spins up and then stops (during the scoring moments). The first part of the SFX is the numbers counting up and the “slap” part of the SFX should coincide with the numbers stopping. This was timed to Innis’ animation, so this should be the proper timing. ^Post lobby^This file plays when the black percentage circle is encircled by the jagged-y blue outline (signifying that they are the winner). This was previously part of a bigger SFX but is now an individual file that can be placed more accurately.^This file plays in the FINAL ROUND when the black percentage circle moves up and then down into the players’ mouth(s). It is different from the mouth SFX for Rounds 1 and 2.^This file plays at the beginning of ROUND TWO, when the text “ROUND TWO” comes onscreen. The second beat of it should hit when the logo gets to its largest size (so it’ll probably start just before you can see the logo).^This file is the stinger SFX for the beginning of ROUND THREE. It plays when the text for “ROUND THREE” comes on. To line it up properly, line the GONG SFX up with “The Last Lash!” text when it’s about a perfect square (before it stretches out to more of a rectangle). It’ll make sense. If not, ask me. [UPDATED 4.23.15]^This file plays in ROUND THREE when the “THE LAST LASH” text flies away offscreen (along with the “Everyone gets the same question” text).^This file plays in the FINAL ROUND, after the prompt is presented and it FLIES AWAY.^This file plays in the SETTINGS POPUP WINDOW when the “fullscreen” button is clicked. It works for both going to fullscreen and for going from fullscreen back to a window.^ This file plays in the SETTINGS POPUP WINDOW when any of the choices in the window are highlighted by the goldish bar.^This file plays in the SETTINGS POPUP WINDOW when a settings choice is turned ON or OFF (by clicking the “on” or “off” choice.^This file plays in the SETTINGS POPUP WINDOW when you click on the volume to make it either louder or softer.^This file plays in the SETTINGS and HOW-TO POPUP WINDOW when the window itself comes ONSCREEN or goes OFFSCREEN.^This file plays at the end of THE LAST LASH, when the remaining cards fly away.^This file plays right before the FINAL SCORES moment, when the BLACK SCREEN comes down from the top.^This file plays when the black screen opens (side-to-side) right before the FINAL SCORES are shown. It is immediately followed by the drumroll (QUIPSFX122).^This file is a LOOP and is played immediately after the black screen opens (side-to-side) right before the final scores are shown. It should play until it is cut off by the WINNER SFX (QUIPSFX123).^This file plays during the FINAL SCORES moment when the WINNER(S) slam on to center screen. This file cuts off the drum roll (QUIPSFX122).^This file plays during FINAL SCORES when each player pops on before the winner is revealed.^This file plays during FINAL SCORES when the WINNER animates OFFSCREEN after the big reveal.^This file plays after the FINAL SCORES section, when the black screen closes from the sides to the center.^This file plays during the FINAL SCORES section and plays immediately after QUIPSFX123. It’s like, SLAM [short beat] THIS FILE.^This music plays at the end of the game, after the winner is shown and the game is over. This loops (hopefully) until the player decides to quit or start a new game.^This SFX plays in any round when a player has entered his/her answers and their corresponding monster snaps up to the top of the screen, signifying that their answers are entered. It will play simultaneously with their monster’s voice. ^This file plays when the text for ROUND ONE and ROUND TWO flies away after the round intros. (It seems I failed to create a SFX for this.)^This SFX plays in the start screen whenever you click “ESC” or “BACK” or “CLOSE.” Just a multipurpose SFX for those clicks.^This file plays after the game is over, on the CREDITS screen when someone presses either “same players” or “new players.”^This file plays whenever a +$$$ graphic flies offscreen (after a player wins money, after the +0 appears for a Jinx, etc.). ^This file plays when the audience (the image of all the little heads) appears onscreen, sliding in from the center.^This file plays when the AUDIENCE (after voting) either SPLITS APART or MOVES TO ONE PLAYER’S SIDE.^This file plays when someone gets a QUIPLASH and the AUDIENCE all go into the one player’s black circle, and the circle gets the “AUDIENCE FAVORITE” text around it. So, this SFX spans the movement of the audience to the circle and ending with the text surrounding it.  [UPDATED 5.6.15 -- this now has just the movement/slap. The cheer is separate (QUIPSFX139)]^This file plays if a player receives the AUDIENCE FAVORITE text. It should start pretty much immediately after the “slap” part of QUIPSFX138.^This file is for the “NO VOTES” stamp that comes on when no one votes.^This SFX should play in ROUND THREE when the audience holds up the card with their votes for each answer. ^This file plays in the LOBBY after the logo slides to the left and the room code appears.

Who knows, the shirt you make today could be the next \\\"I\\'M WITH STUPID\\\"!^I have brought you to T-Shirt Island to make funny t-shirts and chew bubblegum. And I\\'m ALL OUT OF GUM. But I do have ribbon candy if you\\'re into that.^I\\'ve beckoned you here to T-Shirt Island for one reason and one reason only: to engage in deadly t-shirt battle and maybe play some foosball if there\\'s time. Okay, two reasons.^I\\'ve brought you all here to T-Shirt Island because you are the deadliest t-shirt warriors I know. And because I hate being alone on my birthday.^I\\'ve brought you all here to T-Shirt Island because one of you...is a MURDERER.

You\\'ll find it in a jar under your seat. Eat it now or save it for later.^Just as the prophecy foretold, Earth\\'s greatest T-Shirt champions have gathered to do battle on T-Shirt Island. The prophecy also foretold a lot of stuff that DIDN\\'T happen, but what are you gonna do, amirite?^I have brought you all here to T-Shirt Island to battle for shirt supremacy. And to listen to a very brief timeshare pitch, but we\\'ll get to that later.^Thank you all for joining me on T-Shirt Island. I hope your accommodations will be to your liking. Although one of you is going to have to bunk with me. Fair warning: I am a kicker.^I\\'m glad you could join me on T-Shirt Island. We only have one rule here: have fun! Oh, and make sure you\\'re on time for the Tournament. And no pets. And everyone washes their own dishes. And there are a few more; I\\'ll get you a copy of the rules.^I\\'ve brought you all here to T-Shirt Island because you are the cream of the t-shirt fighting crop. And because I just finished the last season of The Bachelor and I have GOT to talk about it with someone.^I\\'ve brought you here to T-Shirt Island to face the greatest challenge of your lives: helping me choose a picture for my online dating profile. But first, let\\'s do this tournament.^I have brought you all here to T-Shirt Island, because you are the Earth\\'s last hope for survival. Haha, can you imagine?

Did I win?”^“I deserve this!”^“All my dreams are coming true!”^“I am honored to accept this victory.”^<PLAYER>’s t-shirt was so popular that top surgeons from the Mayo Clinic offered to operate on <PLAYER>’s sick mother free of charge. Not only did they cure her completely, they gave her bionic thumbs and a Bluetooth spleen. She calls <PLAYER> for tech support a lot, which is annoying, but mostly worth it.^<PLAYER> donated the licensing rights for the winning t-shirt to the orphanage, saving it from foreclosure. The evil banker was outraged, as he had planned to bulldoze the orphanage and build a sadness factory, but after seeing <PLAYER>’s shirt, he couldn’t help but smile. His face froze that way. He is in constant pain.^<PLAYER> parlayed tournament success into a hit reality show, a highly successful lifestyle brand, and a short-lived singing career in Germany. The only thing all that money couldn’t buy was happiness. But it could buy a robot butler and a lifetime supply of candy. And that was good enough for <PLAYER>.^<PLAYER>’s winning shirt was so incredible that it took weeks for anyone to notice <PLAYER> was just a regular, non-sapient dog who happened to paw the right buttons on a phone. Even so, <PLAYER>’s shirt united the world, and <PLAYER> became the second dog ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.^<PLAYER> used all of the fame and fortune from winning the tournament to open a small sandal shop on Venice Beach. Sometimes, one of the tourists will say “Hey, aren’t you the t-shirt guy?” And <PLAYER> will say, “No. Not anymore. Also I am not a guy. I am an umbrella. Would you like to buy a sandal?”^<PLAYER> retired from competition to study t-shirt science. Decades later, <PLAYER> finally succeeded in creating the one, true perfect shirt…only to find that it was an exact copy of the shirt that won this very tournament. <PLAYER>’s final words were “Well, that was ironic.”^<PLAYER>’s tournament win was just one in a long series of exciting adventures. Like that time <PLAYER> rode a dinosaur, the time <PLAYER> went to Mars, and the time <PLAYER> met the Harlem Globetrotters! Honestly, winning this tournament was the least interesting thing <PLAYER> ever did. Oh well.^<PLAYER> asked that we use this part of the game to raise Fin Rot awareness. Fin Rot is characterized by ragged, frayed fin edges in fish. It’s usually the result of a bacterial or fungal infection, but it can also be caused by stress! To learn how you can help, visit your local aquarium. And tell ‘em <PLAYER> sent ya!^<PLAYER> ‘s t-shirt was so remarkable that the spirits of T-Shirt Island granted <PLAYER> one wish. This was a terrible mistake. Today, <PLAYER> rules the island as a tyrant, devouring anyone who rebels. But, the school system has actually improved, and the monthly luaus are pretty fun. So it’s not all bad.^<PLAYER>’s tournament win wasn’t surprising since <PLAYER> never loses. In fact, <PLAYER> would later win the Illinois State Lottery, three gold medals in sport climbing, and a Spike Video Game Award. It was like that Twilight Zone where the gambler can’t lose. Except not creepy. Just awesome.^<PLAYER>’s winning shirt opened a lot of doors in Hollywood, which lead to an executive producer credit on the long-running sitcom “That’s My Shirt!” Several spinoffs followed, including “My Mother the Shirt!”, “Friends But with Shirts”, and the “Shirt Time Sing-Along Variety Hour.” <PLAYER> is very rich.^<PLAYER> went home after the tournament and had a quiet, pleasant evening.^<PLAYER> tried to explain that entering the tournament had been an accident. <PLAYER> had thought the entry form was for a raffle for a free car wash. Regardless, the mayor gave <PLAYER> the key to the city and made every third Wednesday in November “<PLAYER> Day.” <PLAYER> remains frustrated.^<PLAYER> won the tournament, but failed to win the respect of Uncle Bill, who was offended by <PLAYER> refusal to come work at his house-painting company. Luckily, <PLAYER> eventually came to a point of self-acceptance, and was able to love Uncle Bill for who he is. Uncle Bill’s still a huge jerk though.^<PLAYER> achieved the life-long dream of winning the tournament. This was great, but now <PLAYER> needed a new dream. Maybe being the world’s tallest gardener? Or forming a sled dog team comprised solely of wiener dogs? <PLAYER> is still taking dream suggestions if you’ve got any.^<PLAYER>’s success resulted in many lucrative endorsement deals. For a while, <PLAYER> was the official mascot for “Scaly-O’s,” a breakfast cereal with a lifelike snakeskin texture. The idea failed instantly, but <PLAYER> had been paid up front, so it all basically worked out. Also it turned out <PLAYER> was immortal.^Escape: sfx to play when hitting Esc to exit the Settings screen or Leaderboard^in the Settings screen, when someone turns a setting ON^generic toggle: Can be used when a tiny sfx is needed, such as toggling between Twitch and Session on the Leaderboard^env_amb_rd1bg1: The background-specific ambient sfx for content creation Round ONE, Background One (snow).

Well...that’s good too.[category=host]^The fire marshall said the maximum occupancy for this game should be 5 players, but I can tell you people don’t play by the rules.[category=host]^Eight players? With a party this size, gratuity will automatically be added to your final scores. [category=host]^We’ve got a full boat. Here’s hoping we don’t sink! [category=host]^8 players!? This is either a very fun small get-together, or a very lame party. [category=host]^I’m glad all 8 of you decided to play this game.

I’m famous for hosting this game and for getting beaten up by a baby chimpanzee in an IKEA parking lot.

I told you to stay in the car while I hosted this game!” [category=host]^Hey, I’m Cookie Masterson and I have no idea why they call them “boyfriend jeans.” These things are way too tight on me!

I can tell you’re thinking it.[category=host]^We are gathered here today to witness the union of these two players in trivia.[category=host]^Okay, this is awkward because only one of you will win and the other will lose.

Or, like, go outside?[category=host]^Either there\\'s two of you or my double vision is back.[category=host]^Are you sure we’re not playing poker because I see a pair of Jokers…[laugh]...we have fun here.

OK, in the event of a tie: I’ll decide that you’re both losers [category=host]^Two players. Mano-a-Mano. Head-to-head. Knee-touching-knee. Whoa. I’m sensing some unspoken tension here. [category=host]^A little one on one. Reminds me of my streetball days.[category=host]^Looks like we have a good ol fashioned duel on our hands. Who slapped who with a fancy white glove? [category=host]^Two players? Looks like you\\'ll each have a 50% chance of having zero fun. [category=host]^Just the two of you? Oh, I hope you two made a friendly wager. I LOVE friendly wagers. They’re honestly my favorite kind of wagers! [category=host]^Guess I\\'m the third wheel. [...SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?!][category=host]^So everyone else bailed but you two, huh? [category=host]^I love a two player game. It’s like watching a chess match, but with more wild guessing.[category=host]^Just the two of us? Well, we can make it if we try. But I’m not gonna try that hard.[category=host]^Table for one, I see. No shame in that. Can I get you started with a question?[category=host]^It’s just me and you, huh?  Only one of us will make it out alive.[category=host]^I salute you, solo adventurer, setting out alone into the digital unknown.[category=host]^I love playing games by myself. It reminds me that we are born alone and we die alone. Have fun![category=host]^One player. Looks like it’s just you, me and algorithm spying on the both of us.[category=host]^Hey, since it’s just you and me, I’ll let you steer during the back half of the game.[category=host]^If one player wins the game and no one is around to see it...did it even happen?[category=host]^Player one, please say your name out loud now….[pause]...yeah, it doesn’t do anything, but at least there’s no one around to make fun of you. [category=host]^Since it’s just the two of us, how \\'bout you slip me 10 bucks and we’ll skip the hard ones. [category=host]^They say only the bravest players forge this path alone. They will write ballads about you.[category=host]^Thank you for playing alone. It makes Binjpipe\\'s targeted marketing much more effective.[category=host]^Flying solo.  I like it.  No one else to drag you down.[category=host]^Alright, Justin Timberlake.  I see you are going solo.[category=host]^Player one, I like your odds.[category=host]^Well, well, well...it’s just you, me and the 10 gallons of potato salad I’m going to eat while asking you questions. [category=host]^You are player one and there is only one player. Player one, one player. I love the symmetry.[category=host]^They say one is the loneliest number. I think 92 is. My grandpa basically had no friends at the end.[category=host]^Uno! Uno! Uno! [category=host]^You’re playing by yourself so you can relax. Nobody will know what happens except me and you and whoever I tell and also whoever you tell.[category=host]^Good, I was hoping to get more time alone with you. Let’s meet at my place next time. [category=host]^This will be like a game of solitaire if the Jack of Diamonds heckled your mistakes. [category=host]^Just you? If you’ve done your stretching, we can get started. [category=host]^Ready for your solo? I’ll just sing harmonies in the background[category=host]^It’s just you and me, Thaddeus Chubdonggery. And if that\\'s really your name, I am so sorry.[category=host]^Looks like it’s just you, me, and that dark shadowy figure behind you. FUN![category=host]^Hey, good for you. Who says you need friends or loved ones? [category=host]^One player. I get it. I wouldn’t want anyone to talk over all my hilarious jokes either.[category=host]^Just you? I don’t think that’s sad at all. Of course, I ate spaghetti over the toilet last night.[category=host]^Just us? Well, can you turn the lights off? I’m a little self-conscious.[category=host]^So you’re playing with yourself. Hmm...nope, I don\\'t have a joke for that.[category=host]^No one else is playing? What, did all your cats get crushed under the same stack of old newspapers? [category=host]^You may be alone right now but remember: you will also be alone after the game.[category=host]^Now I want all of you on your best behavior. This may be gramma’s last year.[category=host]^Ya know in a game like this, you\\'re really competing against yourself. Just kidding. You’re competing with the other players.[category=host]^Everybody ready? I don\\'t want to have to get off the highway once we get going.[category=host]^Looks like a good group. Be careful to not have TOO much fun or you might coalesce into a makeshift family that’s really there for each other in times of trouble. [category=host]^Sure, that\\'s a respectable turnout.[category=host]^Since we’ve got a group, I\\'ll let you take a second and decide who gets eaten first in the event this game gets lost in the woods.[category=host]^What a friendly group of people and one person playing this game against their will...you all know who it is.[category=host]^Remember there is no I in “team,” but there is an I in “only one player can win.”[category=host]^Before we begin, did everyone figure out which cast member of Riverdale they are? Good.[category=host]^Well, smells like everyone is here.[category=host]^While we wait for the others to get here, I’ve been working on this monologue where I’m a sea captain who, oh, you’re all here?  Nevermind.[category=host]^Looking cozy in here.  Let’s get going before we make any more friends.[category=host]^Hey! It’s all of my favorite people and also Player 3![category=host]^Every day I count my lucky stars you all exist.[category=host]^I’ve never met a group of players I didn’t like. Because I refuse to interact with you people in person.[category=host]^Remember, if any of you are undercover cops you have to tell me now.[category=host]^You know you could have squeezed one more person in this game...Next time![category=host]^Here’s a fact: this is a good looking crew.[category=host]^I can tell just from your names that each of you is delightful company on a promenade.[category=host]^I hope it’s okay I gave you all nicknames; Renegade, Jackhammer and...the rest.[category=host]^You’re all playing the same game, but each of you is unique in beautiful and bizarre ways.[category=host]^With numbers like this we’re bound to have at least one survivor. Tell our story.[category=host]^Jeez...with this many players it will be tough keeping the scores in my head.[category=host]^Look to your left, look to your right: one of these people is stupider than you.[category=host]^Look at this group. I want to put you in matching denim shirts and get your portrait taken.[category=host]^Alright you ragtag crew of misfits, time to band together to compete separately. [category=host]^Hmmm… I don’t know who to root for here: you all seem like the underdog.

In fact this might be the greatest moment of your life, so go ahead and savor it before you remember...[category=host]^You\\'re a real high roller! Ol’ big score winner pants. That’ll catch on. But honestly...[category=host]^You really put some distance between you and the competition. Sure it\\'s impressive, but you\\'ve really got to learn to let people in. Until then...[category=host]^I’ve seen some wins, but that was a real shut out. Ya know what, just this once, I\\'m going to let you say it. Ready?

Wait... no... that was definitely my appendix rupturing. I gotta go to the hospital... [category=host]^You completely dominated that game. Next time, let’s come up with a safe word, or even better, a safe phrase. Something like... [category=host]^Unbelievable win. Seems impossible actually. We’re going to need to take a sample and run some tests. And until we get the results back...[category=host]^You won by a ton, but at the end of the day you\\'re only human, right? Right? RIGHT?![category=host]^Winning by this much indicates not only an intellectual, but a moral superiority. Teach me.[category=host]^I’ve seen some wins, but this one takes the cake, eats it and smears the leftovers in the competition’s face. But don’t let it go to your head because...[category=host]^Sometimes you win big. And sometimes you\\'re everybody else in this game.[category=host]^You won by an embarrassing number of points.

Miracles are everywhere. Just remember...[category=host]^That game was closer than an awkward hug. Not surprising considering...[category=host]^Math says you\\'re just barely our winner. But what does your heart say? Think about that. Then think about this...[category=host]^A win is win, no matter how small. So, so incredibly small. It’s probably safe to say...[category=host]^There are no smalll victories. Except this one. You barely won. I guess what I\\'m saying is...[category=host]^You won by a small margin, but you still technically won. Just like I still technically graduated with a degree in culinary arts. Oh and just a reminder...[category=host]^You should be proud that you barely didn’t lose! Makes sense because...[category=host]^You won by the skin of your teeth. It\\'s super gross, actually. Anyway...[category=host]^I’m sweating that was so close! Wait, no, It\\'s all that pig gristle I had for lunch. Either way...[category=host]^You won by a small enough margin that children under three could choke on it. (rustling paper) Wait what?[category=host]^That was quite a narrow victory. Almost as narrow as my famously narrow esophagus. Now to celebrate your victory with a delicious losenge. (sounds of choking on losenge)[category=host]^That was a photo finish. A terrible, back-lit, weird angle photo finish, but still...[category=host]^It’s not the size of the win that matters, it’s what you do with it. So maybe spend it on some tutoring because... [category=host]^Since you barely won, here’s barely a congratulations: (uninvested) Good Job from all of us here at... [category=host]^(big, excited) We gotta a four-way tie![category=host]^(big, excited) We gotta three-way tie![category=host]^I have to admit you raked in a ton of cash. Do you think your obvious intelligence is scaring away potential trivia opponents? Well, here\\'s what I think...[category=host]^Still, you made some decent cash. I bet if other people were here, you still would have won! And I\\'d still have said this...[category=host]^But do not be afraid of your greatness! I want you to throw open the window and let the whole world know...[category=host]^But look at that score! Smarty should have a party next time. Unless of course...[category=host]^Still, you exceeded expectations, my friend. And to think when I first saw you I thought...[category=host]^Well, your secret genius is safe with me. Just remember...[category=host]^Still, your score was so great I don’t even care about all the awful things people say about you. That\\'s how great I am.[category=host]^When you play these same questions again with someone else and totally crush them, I hope you feel proud of yourself. But don\\'t forget...[category=host]^Your score is pretty great, though. If you applied yourself like this when it came to human interactions, you might have actually impressed someone! But you didn’t so... [category=host]^Well, your life may be empty but your coffers are full, and in the end isn’t that all that matters?[category=host]^Still, with a score like that you should really pat yourself on the back. I mean no one else is going to do it, because...[category=host]^Sure, nobody witnessed this epic conquest, but I will tell your story and let the world know...[category=host]^Still, you sure now how to rack up points, but...[category=host]^Hey, if a tree completely destroys a trivia game in a forest and no one is around to see it, does that mean….[category=host]^Why not grab some witnesses next time so people will stop saying….[category=host]^Well, look at it this way: If trivia points were friends, you’d be very popular.[category=host]^(big, excited) Player 3 wins![category=host]^Player 3 takes it![category=host]^Player 3\\'s got it![category=host]^I had our engineer Ben crunch the numbers and the odds of a four-way tie are 0.00000000003 to 1. Oh wait, these are the odds he gave me that my online dating profile would find my soulmate. Well joke\\'s on you, Ben! How would the four of you like to go get some sushi...? Anyone...? *sigh* Fine, cue the logo.[category=host]^Nicely done, Player 4...[category=host]^I gotta hand it to you Player 4...[category=host]^Well done, Player 4...[category=host]^Nice work Player 4...[category=host]^Way to go, Player 4...[category=host]^Congratulations, Player 4...[category=host]^Excellent job, Player 4...[category=host]^Aren\\'t you cute with your matching scores. I had a hunch you two would find a way to make this all a huge waste of my time. But hey, the scores don\\'t matter as long as you had fun. And if you believe that...[category=host]^Well, you both tried to prove you were smarter than the other one, and you both failed. Next time, bring along a third loser so you\\'ll have someone to lord it over. Now I want you two to face each other and repeat after me...[category=host]^So you both cheated off each other, huh? Well I hope you at least liked the jokes. Here\\'s one more...[category=host]^You both should probably take a break... from each other... seriously, this mind meld thing of yours is creepy. All together now:[category=host]^You two disgust me.[category=host]^I think what this relationship needs is a third, smarter friend.[category=host]^(big, excited) We have an incredibly unlikely tie![category=host]^(unimpressed) Wow, Player 5...[category=host]^(unimpressed) Wow, Player 8...[category=host]^(big, excited) Player 1 wins![category=host]^Player 1 takes it![category=host]^Player 1\\'s got it![category=host]^(big, excited) Player 6 wins![category=host]^Player 6 takes it![category=host]^Player 6 has it![category=host]^I gotta say, there was a second there where I wasn\\'t sure you were going to win. It was before we started, when I assumed another player would join the game.[category=host]^Boy you just barely pulled out a win with such stiff competition.[category=host]^I applaud you! But it’s the sound of one hand clapping.[category=host]^That was a real nail-biter, huh?[category=host]^Congratulations! You knew you could do it![category=host]^One player truly rose above the rest, because there was no \\\"rest.\\\"[category=host]^Well, that\\'s certainly one way to win.[category=host]^You are the hero of your own story.[category=host]^It’s nice when I don’t have to check the scores to see who won.[category=host]^Ah, one player to rule them all. It\\'s almost not embarrassing.[category=host]^A truly brilliant victory...against yourself.[category=host]^Wow, you are the winner! And I guess, technically the loser too.[category=host]^Wow that was as exciting as a one-person staring contest.[category=host]^Ya know, when Einstein was by himself he came up with the theory of relativity. You on the other hand, did this.[category=host]^Thank god you won. I hate to think how your self esteem might have plummeted if you couldn\\'t even beat yourself.[category=host]^Congrats on the win, although I like to think I\\'m the real winner for spending the entire game alone with you and not ripping my eyelids off.[category=host]^You finally did it. You blew it up. You maniac.[category=host]^I mean, what do you want me to say here, you played by yourself. It was more like taking a Cosmo quiz than winning a trivia game.[category=host]^Well, I\\'m proud of you. But not for this.[category=host]^Winning? Losing? It\\'s such a blurry line when you\\'re by yourself isn\\'t it?[category=host]^You really put the you in \\\"you won!\\\"[category=host]^Wow! I guess other players would have only slowed you down.[category=host]^You’re #1 in this game and in my heart.[category=host]^You survived a whole game by yourself! Amazing![category=host]^Congratulations! You’re first, last and all the places inbetween.[category=host]^Believe me when I say...you were the most valuable player[category=host]^It looks like you’re the only survivor...I mean...winner[category=host]^The prophecy said there would be only one. But I never expected it to be you.[category=host]^You got the highest score and you were the best looking person in this game. Not counting me.[category=host]^Hey, just because losing was impossible, doesn’t mean you didn’t win.[category=host]^Congratulations, you played yourself and you won.[category=host]^You won! Because you couldn’t lose![category=host]^Technically this is a victory![category=host]^A big fat goose egg for both of you. I\\'d actually be impressed if I wasn\\'t so...not. But hey, in tennis they call this \\\"love\\\" and I can tell you two were meant for each other because...[category=host]^Hey look at that! You ended with the same scores you started with! You two could have skipped the game and had a meaningful conversation over coffee, and still had the exact same number of points! But at least we proved one thing once and for all...[category=host]^Excellent job, Player 5...[category=host]^I gotta hand it to you Player 5...[category=host]^Well done, Player 5...[category=host]^Nice work Player 5...[category=host]^Way to go, Player 5...[category=host]^Congratulations, Player 5...[category=host]^Nicely done, Player 5...[category=host]^(big, excited) Player 4 wins![category=host]^Player 4 takes it![category=host]^Player 4\\'s got it![category=host]^(unimpressed) Wow, Player 6...[category=host]^(big, excited) Player 2 wins![category=host]^Player 2 takes it![category=host]^Player 2\\'s got it![category=host]^Let\\'s try to get that player count up to two next time, huh? Then there\\'ll be a witness when I tell you...[category=host]^And it was a job, well? Done. Maybe next time someone else will be there to remind you...[category=host]^At least you got some practice for when you make a friend.[category=host]^You don’t know this, because you have no one to compare it to, but this is a very average score, which reminds me...[category=host]^You could have done better but hey, who cares? Nobody is here to witness your mediocrity. And here\\'s another little secret...[category=host]^It’s probably for the best that no one else was here because...[category=host]^And a truly middle of the road job to remind you that...[category=host]^At least you\\'ve got an extremely mediocre score to show off to your friends. Oh wait...[category=host]^Just like a pair of khakis in an empty closet, you are average, you are alone, and also...[category=host]^I hope you found whatever you were looking for here.[category=host]^I don\\'t want to give you a big head, but you might be ready to play a game with actual humans. Then again...[category=host]^I had a really funny line to end this game with, but...yeah...I shouldn\\'t waste it on a single player game. Next time![category=host]^At least there\\'s no one else around to talk over the hilarious joke I\\'m going to end this game with. Now, uh...where did I put...uh oh. Oh no. Save me, logo![category=host]^Ya know, it wouldn\\'t hurt to bring a friend along next time. Maybe that cute barista at the coffee shop? I\\'m kidding, please don\\'t bother her, she\\'s got enough to deal with.[category=host]^Next time try asking your mom to play with you. Or my mom. Anything to get her out of the house.[category=host]^I hope someone somehwere is proud of you. Just don\\'t tell them this part...[category=host]^Anyway, your score\\'s fine. Not great. Not bad. Which makes sense, considering...[category=host]^Maybe next time you\\'ll have a more impressive score to go along with your victory. Until then...[category=host]^No parades will be held to honor your moderate win, but if there was one it\\'d have a float that says…[category=host]^I have to admit, though, your score was impressively mediocre. Not that it matters, since...[category=host]^This monument to mediocrity proves once and for all...[category=host]^Still, you did the bare minimum of what was asked of you. Which is impressive considering...[category=host]^And you finished with the unbuttered white bread of scores. You couldn’t even toast it, because….[category=host]^As for your score, I’m not in love it. But I\\'m willing to consider it a friend, even though...[category=host]^As for your score, it\\'s nothing to write home about, maybe just text an emoji to let your mom know…[category=host]^And you didn’t exactly storm the scoreboard, it was more of a little drizzle, a slight breeze whispering…[category=host]^All in all, this game was no day at the beach, but if you hold a seashell up to your ear you can hear it say…[category=host]^Still, you scored just well enough to look at yourself in the mirror, stand tall and say….[category=host]^It\\'s rare to see three players bone things up in exactly the same way, but I guess you guys are just really in sync. Oh and here\\'s another fun fact about you...[category=host]^Ya know usually there\\'s one player who\\'s really good at this game, so they make their loser friends play with them. But this...I don\\'t know what to think about this. Wait, yes I do...[category=host]^Why did you guys even bother?[category=host]^(unimpressed) Wow, Player 3...[category=host]^Ya know, they make me come up with something to say for every possible situation, but this many player tying is so unlikley that I only bothered to jot down a few notes. Let\\'s see here... (SFX crinkling paper) Blah blah incredible...you\\'re all the exact same amount of smart-slash-dumb...once in a lifetime yadaya... Oh and here at the bottom it says one last thing...[category=host]^I hope you feeel good about that. I mean, life is still meaningless and we\\'ll all die alone. But remember, a win\\'s a win! And here\\'s something else to remember...[category=host]^You did it!  Now try to apply this level of effort to something else in your life. And keep this in mind...[category=host]^No one thought you could do it, but you won!  Congrats, my friend, even though we all know…[category=host]^You won!  Anyone you want to thank?  Too bad we don’t have time.[category=host]^Nothing feels as good as winning.  Except maybe eating cake.  Mmmmm, cake.[category=host]^I never thought YOU would win. But what do I know? Well, I do know this...[category=host]^You won. Bask in this. Baskinthis. Basilisk....what was I saying?[category=host]^You\\'re the big bad winner. Maybe one day we won\\'t need to have winners and losers and we can all be equals. (sighs mournfully). Anyway…[category=host]^Now that you’ve won, I find myself kind of nervous around you. Have you gotten taller and more champion-like? Well, one thing\\'s for sure...[category=host]^You not only won the this game, but you’ve won the thanks of a grateful nation. Which is especially impressive considering...[category=host]^I’m happy for you, truly.  And that’s coming from a man who chose not to feel things anymore.  Just don’t forget this…[category=host]^You are the winner!  But don’t let that define you.  Because, in the end…[category=host]^The sweet smell of victory.  Wait, that’s just the brownie I left in my pocket. Oh man. I have got a date with a pocket brownie.[category=host]^Come on down and claim your prize...which is my respect and admiration. It has zero monetary value.[category=host]^You won the game and you looked good doing it. You sure know your way around a hairstyle, but you should also know this:[category=host]^I would have pegged you for one of the stupider ones! Still, you and I both know how this ends...[category=host]^You sure did win this game. But remember: there are no winners in the grave... (distant) No winners in the grave...[category=host]^From this day henceforth you shall be known as that person who won that game that one time. It’s mostly an honorary title, because...[category=host]^When you win, you win for everyone.  Just kidding! You\\'re the real winner. As for your competition...[category=host]^You were averagely better than your competition, so even though you’re a winner...[category=host]^That was a real rags to riches story! I can’t wait till it you get back to rags because…[category=host]^I’m glad the underdog won! You did know you were the underdog right?[category=host]^How does it feel to win?  Like diving into a pool of pudding and eating your way out?  No?  Just asking.[category=host]^You won the game!  Put on your party pants and celebrate, unless you\\'re already wearing them. Look, do what you want.[category=host]^You won, which I’m pretty sure is the greatest thing you’ve done to date.  Way to shut down the haters who said…[category=host]^Amazing job.  I have tears in my eyes, but that’s just years of personal regret building up.  As for you, well…[category=host]^You will henceforth be known as winner, and your competition will forever hear whispers saying…[category=host]^Feel that?  That’s what winning feels like.  Like one million thread counts sheets.  As for your competition...[category=host]^Look who’s on top now!  Enjoy the view from up there because tomorrow you’ll probably realize…[category=host]^Next round\\'s on you! I\\'ll have a cosmo. No wait. An appletini. No wait. A grasshopper. Get me a grasshopper......no wait![category=host]^Commence loud and slowly intensifying slow clap. Are you doing it? This is great, right? Yeah![category=host]^You won!  Confetti, confetti, confetti!  Verbal confetti is easier to clean up!  Enjoy![category=host]^I’m so proud of you I’m going to hang this win on my refrigerator right next to my to-do list. Oh that reminds me, I should tell you...[category=host]^Try to enjoy this fleeting moment of glory before you remember…[category=host]^What a standard, everyday, run of the mill win.  Next time maybe you\\'ll hear what I say when you get an IMPRESSIVE score. Until then...[category=host]^You won.  What are you waiting for?  My validation? ...Go away![category=host]^Way to go, Player 7...[category=host]^I gotta hand it to you Player 7...[category=host]^Well done, Player 7...[category=host]^Nice work Player 7...[category=host]^Congratulations, Player 7...[category=host]^Excellent job, Player 7...[category=host]^Nicely done, Player 7...[category=host]^(big, excited) We gotta tie![category=host]^It\\'s a tie![category=host]^We have a tie![category=host]^Wow, the elusive three-way tie. As rare as it is completely unsatisfying. I bet you guys finish each other\\'s sentences. And if you can\\'t guess how this one\\'s going to end...[category=host]^Great tie Moe, Larry, and Curly. Wait that\\'s an incredibly outdated reference. Uh, nice tie there...Rocky, Colt, and Tum Tum. No no wait, congratulations you Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Nailed it.[category=host]^Ya know when there\\'s one winner I\\'m excited. When there\\'s two I\\'m REALLY excited. But three? It\\'s just too much. I\\'m over you.[category=host]^At least no one else saw that trainwreck of a performance. No one but me that is. One day years from now, when you\\'ve finally forgotten how you stunk up this game, you\\'ll get a phone call in the middle of the night. And on the other end of the line you\\'ll hear...[category=host]^Wait, is finishing with a negative score really a win? I gotta check the rule book. In the mean time, remember this...[category=host]^Tell ya what, I\\'ll try to keep it quiet that you won with a negative score. Oops. I tweeted it.[category=host]^Hey, quick question: If a tree falls in the forest and no one\\'s there to hear it, and also the tree has an embarrassing negative score, was this a huge waste of my time?[category=host]^You didn’t know the answers and you didn’t know anyone who would play with you, but you should know this...[category=host]^Let’s make a pact. I\\'ll promise to keep your incredibly low score a secret. You promise to write this in sharpie on your forehead...[category=host]^Still, you managed to turn a negative into a positive. But that doesn\\'t change the most important fact...[category=host]^Winning with a score that low is more humiliating than the time my mom walked in on me and I had to cancel my subscription to Woman’s World Magazine. I’ll tell you what she told me... [category=host]^I’d actually be impressed if I wasn’t so depressed. The only joy I can squeeze out of this is telling you this...[category=host]^Maybe next time you\\'ll end with a positive score. And maybe next time I won\\'t say this...[category=host]^In the future, these can be the ashes that you rise from….because right now…[category=host]^And look at that score. You started from the bottom and now you’re even lower. At least the journey taught us….[category=host]^And judging by your score, I assume you donated all your points to a good cause. The only other option is….[category=host]^At least you\\'re not a quitter. You hit the bottom and just kept digging. Take a break and think about this...[category=host]^Your score may be negative but I’m positive that…[category=host]^Judging by your score, I’ll try not to use big words when I tell you…[category=host]^Next time, maybe shoot for the moon and try to score 0 points. Then you can proudly proclaim...[category=host]^Nothing like a tie to really take the drama out of a trivia game, huh? All that effort and no real winner. Of course you COULD say you both won. And you could also say...[category=host]^You two might have tied, but at least you didn\\'t flat out lose like these other losing losers. This was disappointing for everyone is what I\\'m saying. But let me leave you with one final thought...[category=host]^Ties are usually pretty disappointing, so we put a lot of effort into making sure they don\\'t happen that often. And then you two go and screw it up. Anyway, thanks for playing.[category=host]^Good game, you two. You both have a lot to be proud of. In your personal lives I mean, not this. This is a very forgetable achievement.[category=host]^This is embarrassing, but since we don\\'t get a lot of ties, I decided to hide my email password in this audio file. That way no one would ever stumble on it accidentally. But you two tied, so here it is: *ahem* AnkleBoner78. I...like ankles.[category=host]^Two players with the same score? What is this, one of our less rigorously playtested games? Well at least somebody actually won. I\\'m looking at you, Tee K.O.[category=host]^I hope you two are happy. Sincerely, I really hope you\\'re happy. Sorry if that sounded sarcastic.[category=host]^Two winners? This is going to be a lot of paperwork, but I guess I\\'ll let it slide. I\\'ll just need you two to sign a statement to the following effect...[category=host]^I hope you two like seeing  both of your names in the winner slot. Our art director didn\\'t love it, but what are ya gonna do, redesign the entire screen for an edge case? There are only so many hours in the day, people. Anyway...[category=host]^Ties are always so anticlimactic. Next time I\\'ll come up with some questions that only one of you will know. Which of you is a bigger According to Jim fan?[category=host]^(big, excited) Player 5 wins![category=host]^Player 5 takes it![category=host]^Player 5\\'s got it![category=host]^Well done, Player 2...[category=host]^I gotta hand it to you Player 2...[category=host]^Nice work Player 2...[category=host]^Way to go, Player 2...[category=host]^Congratulations, Player 2...[category=host]^Excellent job, Player 2...[category=host]^Nicely done, Player 2...[category=host]^AN EIGHT-WAY tie? What are you guys robots? Or some kind of creepy mind-melded cult? Waitaminute, is this our QA department testing the game? Jacobs is this you? Go home, Jacob! Or maybe you were just hoping something funny would happen. Well sorry to disappoint you,but--(PROLONGED FART SOUND). Uh...excuse me.[category=host]^An EIGHT WAY tie? The odds are pretty much against that. Much better odds you manipulated the game to find out if this scenario would trigger the custom audio file you\\'re hearing right now. Is it everything you hoped for? Anyway, since you know the game so well, here\\'s the part where you hear the slam and the words You Don\\'t Know Jack. Wait for it... should be any time now...  [I ADDED THIS JUST CUZ I FIGURE SOME SUPERFAN MIGHT GO TO THESE LENGTHS][category=host]^(incredulous because it\\'s an 8-way tie) Oh COME ON.[category=host]^I gotta hand it to you Player 8...[category=host]^Well done, Player 8...[category=host]^Nice work Player 8...[category=host]^Way to go, Player 8...[category=host]^Congratulations, Player 8...[category=host]^Excellent job, Player 8...[category=host]^Nicely done, Player 8...[category=host]^(big, excited) Player 8 wins![category=host]^Player 8 takes it![category=host]^Player 8\\'s got it![category=host]^(unimpressed) Wow, Player 4...[category=host]^(unimpressed) Wow, Player 1...[category=host]^I can\\'t wait to see your victoy tweets about how you \\\"WON\\\" this game. Maybe you can tastefully crop out that big fat zero in the screencap.[category=host]^This proves that even a zero can be a hero.[category=host]^You’ve shown us it literally takes nothing to win.[category=host]^From zero to hero, the story of you.[category=host]^I\\'ve gotta make a point of pointing out that you have no...points.[category=host]^I guess when people call you a zero, it\\'s actually a compliment?[category=host]^Zero? If you weren’t so obviously dumb I would think you did this on purpose! [category=host]^You won with zero points. What is this? Some sort of social commentary? [category=host]^The sad thing is you probably think ENDING UP with no points is cool.[category=host]^You achieved nothing and YOU\\'RE STILL ON TOP.[category=host]^I SUPPOSE You wisely let your enemy defeat themselves?[category=host]^If everyone else runs backwards, there’s no reason to leave the starting line, right?[category=host]^WELL I guess technically you can count this as a win. And here\\'s another uncomfortable truth... [RE-DID THIS. NEEDS NEW NORMALIZE][category=host]^But let\\'s just focus on your victory. That and one other thing...[category=host]^I\\'m just glad the suffering is over, because honestly...[category=host]^I think you\\'ve all made one thing clear today...[category=host]^Let\\'s hear a solid two and a half cheers for the winner, and keep in mind...[category=host]^I just appreciate you all taking the time to show me...[category=host]^Ya know, these words have never been more true... [category=host]^Now all together, with feeling... [category=host]^Your honor, let the record show that the \\\"You\\\" in the about to be spoken phrase refers to all present and stupid players...[category=host]^You should go out and get matching tattoos. And I know just what they should say...[category=host]^And if these numbers don\\'t make sense to you...[category=host]^Now, that losers are winners, there\\'s only one fact we can depend on...[category=host]^Yes, it was a wild race to the bottom, but once you got there you discovered...[category=host]^But at least we all had fun...and if you buy that...[category=host]^Good luck spinning this to the share holders, because...[category=host]^A score that low doesn\\'t usually have the word WINNER attached to it.[category=host]^This score defies science.[category=host]^I didn’t think you COULD win with a score like that.[category=host]^Do you kiss your mom with that score?[category=host]^Way to turn a negative into a positive.[category=host]^Thank you for showing everyone that even losers win sometimes.[category=host]^You really turned lemons into slightly better lemons.[category=host]^Math just called. It’s mad about your victory[category=host]^Your success was so cool it was below zero[category=host]^You won, but at what cost? [category=host]^I believe that’s called failing up[category=host]^That was so bad and yet you\\'re being celebrated. What, are you the Zack Snyder of Trivia? [category=host]^You finished in the negative but still came out ahead. Just like my broker.[category=host]^You really snuck under that positive score like a limbo dancer[category=host]^IT\\'S LIKE you flew low to avoid radar? I DUNNO.[category=host]^I wish I could avoid calories the way you avoid points.[category=host]^You are the definition of an UNDERachiever.[category=host]^You did the least bad, and I\\'m forced to congratulate you for it.[category=host]^Lucky you found the one person in the unvierse who\\'s worse at this game than you.[category=host]^I hope you two can look YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR AFTER THIS. BOTH OF YOU WERE TERRIBLE.[category=host]^One of you should be ashamed. And the other one actually lost.[category=host]^Of course the odds were 50/50 in your favor.[category=host]^And here I thought you two would tie for worst.[category=host]^Lucky your opponent couldn\\'t do even slightly better. [category=host]^Was this one of those things where you both tried to let the other one win and it got out of hand? [category=host]^At least your opponent\\'s here to remind us that there\\'s always further to fall.[category=host]^And yet somehow your opponent dug even deeper.[category=host]^And yet somehow, your friends are even worse at this than you are.[category=host]^This game was like a pile of garbage with one salvageable piece at the top.[category=host]^Of course, with friends like these, does anyone truly win?[category=host]^And yet, compared to the competition, I might as well just congratulate you for remembering to breathe.[category=host]^Lucky your friends all entered into some kind of losers pact.[category=host]^I guess you\\'re friends with these guys because you all skipped school together?[category=host]^Did the rest of you just sit on your phones the whole game? [category=host]^And from the looks of your competition, I doubt the rest of these jokers even understand what happened.[category=host]^Don\\'t spend it all in one place.[category=host]^Buy yourself something nice.[category=host]^You can thank me later.[category=host]^We\\'ll see if your luck hold out.[category=host]^Consider that your birthday present.[category=host]^Not a bad showing, but we\\'ve got at least a few dummies in the group.[category=host]^Decent.

I don’t want my friends to die!” ^No see, you made it too easy. You should take a game theory class. There’s a great one at the learning annex, but you won’t live long enough to check it out.^Ooookay. I guess someone’s too afraid to make enemies.^*sigh* Wow you are ruining this for me.^Oh come on, with odds of survival that high I’m barely even aroused.^Hey, if I wanted to watch a game with no stakes I would have hosted Word Spud.^High^Roll Higher than me or you die!^Low^Roll Lower than me or you die!^Aww!

I love to see it, but I assume you hate to see it.^Yes! Oh it feels so good!^I was so hoping this would happen.^They say you make your own luck. So make sure to blame this on yourself.^I thought I told you to roll the dice...^I gave you plenty of time to roll.^You should have bothered to roll your dice.^Well that was a bust! ^What a waste.^(sarcastic) So much for THAT game.^The choice is yours. ^You can make it as hard or as easy as you want.^Ugh fine.

It shouldn\\'t take this long.^The stakes couldn\\'t be any lower for you. Just pick one.^Come on pick! You\\'re annoying me.^Back to the game...^Okay, back to it...^Okay, where were we...^A decision has been made. ^The terms have been set.^Okay. Seems… doable. I don’t know. I’ts a toss-up.^Okay, your part is done. Thank you.^Hmm. We’ll see how this goes.^Well, this is gonna be a toss-up.^This could go either way. Exciting.^Oooh. There’s some wiggle room. Let’s see how this goes.^Very interesting. I’m hoping for bad things.^I’m curious how this’ll play out.^Hmm odds are about even there. I don’t know how to feel about this. ^Way to go, Blandy McBoringChoice.^The math says this could go either way. Although the fact that you’re in a murder dungeon skews the odds a bit.^Great, we’re all very impressed with your choice.^Oh, lucky, lucky!^You’re safe.^The dice were on your side.^Good roll.^THAT’S what you needed.^I guess the dice like you.^Lucky dice.^No fun.^Oooh. You nailed it.^Papa got some brand new shoes.^Well poop to you and your lucky dice.^Well that stinks.^I don’t believe it. (sulking) Good job, I guess.^Dang it. I guess you get to live… for now.^Somehow you didn’t screw this up. ^Darn, that’s what you needed.^The worst people are always the luckiest.^There’s magic in those wrists of yours.^Well, well. Live to die another day.^No fair! You used probability against me!^Oh big whoop. Dice rolls are random, don’t feel good about yourself.^Whatever. I don’t care. You’re dumb.^Good. Fine. I wanted to kill you later anyway.^I am furious right now. ^Making it hard on them. I like it! ^Ooooo. That’ll be a tough roll.^Wow. Okay. Not pulling any punches, huh?^What a wonderfully mean-spirited choice.^Oooh. You’re evil!^Whoa. That’s not easy. What did they ever do to you?^Oooh. Somebody came to play!^That’s an aggressive move and I endorse it.^And I thought I was cruel!^You must have a personal vendetta or something.^Whoa, even I give my victims a CHANCE.

Nice talkin’ to ya.^Hold on… you’re not my wife! Why am I talking to you? Get away from me, weirdo.^And if you’re thinking I’ve secretly been the killer this whole time… wouldn’t that be a crazy twist ending? But nope. Nope. I’m just a weird old man that’s talking to you for no reason. Don’t mind me.^No one knows what happened to the killer, some say he’s… [Killer voice: “Right behind you!”] Oh no! The killer! [sfx: stab sfxs] Well… I’ve been stabbed…. Didn’t see that one comin’.^Well, thanks for listening to an old man ramble. Doctors say if I stop talking, I’ll die.^You know, around here it’s customary to tip an old man after he’s told a spooky story. Eh? Eh? Ah, get out of here you cheap tourist. ^Now don’t go stealing that story. I’m already in talks with a producer in Hollywood.

Talks through a voice filter and he’s always reading the encyclopedia. Oh well, takes all kinds.^Anyway, after all that, wouldn’t you know it, the psycho up and kidnapped me, chained me to the wall, and that pretty much brings us to now.

Goodbye.^One person^Two people.^Three people^Four people^Five people^Six people^Seven people^Eight people^Nine people^Not really sure why they’d volunteer for something like that in the first place.^Some people say the audience should consider buying the game for themselves, but I don’t really know what they mean by that.^The audience barely got to play because they weren’t in the audience for a show about smart people.^From what I hear, the audience experience was not quite as good as playing the game directly, but still, a reasonably fun thing to do.^I guess kids consider it cool these days to let other people determine their fate.^Sounds like a bunch of freeloaders who need to buy the game if you ask me. ^I guess they like to watch other people have fun. Weirdos, if you ask me.^Yeah, every peeping tom this side of the Mississippi was playing along too.^I reckon you must be pretty lonesome to witness something like that.^Yup, instead of calling the cops, they just answered along with them. Pretty sick stuff. ^Suppose they were just after some cheap thrills. Can’t say I blame them.^Guess they didn’t have anything better to do.^Which I didn’t know was a thing.

I don’t really understand the technology.^A horror themed trivia game show. But the questions weren’t all about horror stuff. Honestly, it sounds confusing.^A party game but with creepy stuff added. I don’t know. I think maybe I’d understand it better if I was a millennial.^A game of wits but with this weird guy who subjected people to terrible jokes. I heard he even had writers. Terrible writers.^A deadly game that danced around sex and drug references but never explicitly said them so as not to affect their game rating.^An eerie party game where people died for not knowing trivia questions, at least that’s what the press release said.^A spooky party game where you used your phone to play… I think. I kinda zoned out when the sheriff was going on about it.^A macabre host kidnapped some folks and forced them to answer a bunch of trivia questions.^A demented killer forced a bunch of folks to answer some trivia. Worse than going to pub trivia, they say.^A party game that still had a single player option. Some pretty senseless, confusing stuff.^A twisted trivia game show with a lot of pop culture references that would go over my head.^Some kind of “comedy” game show. Not my type of humor. ^Some sicko kidnapped people and forced them to play a sick game. And also he’d give them money when they got things right? It was all a little confusing. ^A terrifying game with a high concept premise that served as a framework for several smaller game concepts.

I’d also avoid that old house up on the hill.^I’d stay away from the old abandoned movie backlot if I were you.^I’d stay away from that old slaughterhouse if I were you. ^I wouldn’t go snooping around that old abandoned Big & Tall store if I were you.^I wouldn’t go up to that old abandoned rest stop and tourist information center if I were you.^Died too... Didn’t do better than the top player.^Don’t get mad at me. THEY ganged up on you for kind of no reason. They didn’t even have to. They’re kind of mean, right?^It’s gotta hurt that other players thought, “Hey, I might as well try to kill you. Why not?”^Killed by other players is probably the creepiest thing that can happen in this game if you think about it.^It’s kind of weird that the other players wanted you dead, right? Like, they didn’t have THAT much to gain. They just wanted you dead!^Whoa! This went from a simple murder party to creepy, sociological experiment. You are playing with some grim people.^I know I started this by pitting you against each other, but wow, your friends are ruthless.^They ganged up and killed you! You probably thought they liked you, but then they just straight up killed you! That’s gotta mess with your mind.^To be fair, predators are supposed to attack the weakest link.^You think you know who your friends are and then they viciously attack you in a trivia game. Same old story. ^It’s not just that everybody ganged up on you, they were smiling while they were doing it! ^You\\'re doing the best so you get one more chance. The time has come...^I brought you back to life because you\\'re more or less doing the best. Okay, let\\'s go...^I don\\'t want to hear any complaints about not bringing EVERYONE back to life, okay?! Anyway, back to business...^You get to live a wee bit longer because you\\'re doing the best. And I like you. Okay, moving on...^Only one of you still alive. You know what that means...^Only one of you is still alive. You know what that means...^Oh good. We\\'re just down to one.^Only one player left alive. Just how I like it.^The whittling down to just one player has finally come to fruition. Let\\'s do this.^Oh look. Only one player left. Perfect.^Okay… huh… this is embarrassing. I don’t have any more regular trivia questions for you. I didn’t expect you to live this long, and all I have left are final round questions. I don’t know whether to blame you for being too smart or blame myself for cutting corners, content-wise. Either way, it’s time to speed things up.^Okay, this next question is really good. [sfx: distant sound of police sirens] Uh oh. Do you hear that? [sfx: more distant police sirens] Sound the police are closing in. Time for a slight change of plans.^I hope you like questions about obscure tax code law because… [sfx: egg timer ding] Oh, that’s my egg timer I set for this game. I’ve been trying to keep the game from going too long. I don’t want to be cruel about it, you know. So, we gotta speed things up a bit.^Let’s see (slightly distracted) this next question… hmm… I don’t really like that one. [sfx: papers shuffling] No. No. Too easy. Man, the rest of these questions are not up to my usual standards. Maybe it’s time to cut our losses.^So, for this next question… [sfx: digital timer sound] Oops, accidentally bumped that time bomb on my desk…. Aaaannnnd…. It’s activated now. Don’t worry, it’s not going to blow up immediately but… uh… we should probably pick up the pace here a little bit.^(sfx: knocking over a can of liquid) Oh poop. I just kicked over a can of chloroform. We’ve got a short amount of time before the fumes overtake us.^You know what smarty-pants? I was hoping to cut out early today so I could start my vacation. Going up to Big Sur. Gonna do a little camping, pick off a few hikers. You know, relaxing Zodiac stuff. But you just won’t die.^(Has to pee) Uh, I don’t want to say it’s an emergency, but I drank like six lattes and a pitcher of lemonade before we started, so yeah, it’s an emergency. I haven’t peed my pants in seventy-three days and I’m not breaking the streak today.^(SFX: text message sound) Oh shoot I almost forgot! I rent out my dungeon to tourists and they’re gonna be checking in soon so I really need to end this game and tidy up before they get here. I CAN NOT afford another 1 star rating from another guest.^Did one of you just look at the clock?! Did I see a yawn?! This game is going on too long, isn’t it? No, it’s ok, you can say it. I feel the energy of the room. It’s my job as the facilitator to make sure the pacing is right, so I’m gonna move this along.^Out of all the people I could’ve kidnapped, I picked a bunch of Ken Jennings! Well, unlike Alex Trebek, I’m a host who actually takes initiative. So we’re done with these trivia questions and moving on… ^Okay guys, I’m going to say to you what I said to my grandmother: I did not expect you to live this long. We gotta speed this up.^So, I’m guessing you guys are always the last ones hanging around the party when the host just wants to go to sleep. Time for you to take the hint and DIE.^So, this is awkward, but I actually have another group of victims showing up real soon. I mean, we never said we were exclusive, right? Anyway, in the interest of time... ^What are you going to do with all that money? I know of a great timeshare opportunity. ^This is the most fun I’ve had since I binge watched Stranger Things on Netflix. So fun.^Oh, I got a Facebook notification! Typical. I just got tagged in another spam ad for sunglasses.^jumpcut1^jumpcut2^jumpcut3^jumpcut4^jumpcut5^Let’s just take a moment or two for that information to slowly drift out of your short term memory. A little time for you to forget what the things were, what the colors were. A little time for you to mess up basically.^Is it distracting if I start yelling things out? FISH… KNIFE… GLASSES… ZIGGY… (chuckles to self)^And don’t get me started on how memorization is a lost artform ever since the introduction of smart phones. I could talk your ear off.^Is it distracting if I start yelling out CAR… DUCK… SQUARE… WISCONSIN… (chuckles to self)^Sorry to do this in the middle of a minigame, but I need to do my relaxation exercises. Breath in. Breath out. Breath in. Breath out. Ah, yes. That’s good. That helps center me.^Ok, we have a little bit of time to fill so let me read to you an excerpt from an interview Gary Sinise gave on the Tavis Smiley show in 2011. His take on CSI: NY: “I have lots of friends who are wonderful actors. They’d like to be in my shoes so I’m going to just keep enjoying it.” Ok, now back to the game. ^We have a little time to fill so I’d like to take this opportunity and ask if anybody knows of a good natural deodorant brand. The aluminum in the big brands worry me so I think I wanna make the switch. Anyway, hit me up on email if you have any recommendations. Thanks. But where were we? Oh yeah...^I have to stretch this segment a bit. Speaking of stretching, have you guys tried the Half Moon pose? My yoga instructor made us do it last class, and I gotta say, I think it’s nearly impossible. We just weren’t meant to bend like that. But I digress.^Speaking of memories, I can never remember the difference between an alpaca and a llama. Llamas are smaller and have shorter ears, right? Oh, wait. I think I got that backwards. I honestly don’t know. See what I mean?! Alright, let’s see how you’ll do!^I hope your memory’s better than mine – all day I’ve been trying to remember the name of the guy from that HBO show… man, who is that?! I think his first name starts with a C… or an L? Ugh, it’s driving me bananas. [beat] You know what, forget it. Let’s get back to the cards—BRIAN BENBEN! That’s it! Okay, anyway…^You know, I still remember my locker combination from 8th grade gym class. It was 25 to the right… four to the left… but you had to skip the first four and then go aaaaalll the way around again until you hit the 4 for a second time, then 34 to the right. 25-4-34. Why do I still remember that?! Life is so weird sometimes. Anyway…^And while we have a second, I want to take a second and let you know that the brown-footed lemur is almost extinct due to the deforestation of Madagascar. So, if you care about the planet like I do, here’s what YOU can do… (sfx: phone ping) Oh. Google alert. They’re extinct. Never mind.^And while I’m thinking, next to your shackled feet, you’ll find some comment cards and a golf pencil. If you could just write down what you like about being held captive and forced to play for your life and what you didn’t, it would really help me get my Trip Advisor score up. So what were we doing? Oh yeah, memory game.^I know this a weird time to bring it up, but I just learned to play the glockenspiel. Want to hear? (sfx: crappy glockenspiel) That was that Alicia Keys song. Could you tell? Eh, forget it. (sfx: crashing glockenspiel) ^ And just to be a jerk, I think I’ll wait a few seconds and see if your memory can hold up. So what’s news with everyone? Anybody take up any new hobbies? I’m really into needlepoint right now. Mostly just stitching the word “poop” and hanging it over my toilet. Hmmm. Oh well, that’s enough time.^END: Audience Lives Newspaper ON\\nThis SFX plays at the end of the game if the AUDIENCE LIVES and the NEWSPAPER spins ON.^END: Newspaper Spins OFF\\nThis SFX plays at the end of the game when the newspaper(s) spins off. (It may need to be back timed a touch as it ramps up a little.)^END: Reboot Franchise Button\\nThis SFX plays at the end of the game when the “Reboot Franchise” button is pressed.^END: Play Sequel Button\\nThis SFX plays when the “PLAY SEQUEL” button is pressed to start a new game.^You know this game can get pretty hectic… I worked pretty hard on the timing… but let’s take a moment to just relax for a little bit, enjoy each other’s company. Isn’t that nice? We should do this more often. Anyway…^Oh man, I am parched. I’m really bad about remembering to stay hydrated. Just a second while I have a little water. [drinks water for a bit] Okay. Woo. Sorry about that. Anyway…^Did you know some people like to stream this game online? It’s great but sometimes the delay can cause weird moments where you can see something you’re not supposed to be able to still see. I don’t even know why I’m explainging this to you. Anyway…^Woah. I just suddenly had the strongest sense of déjà vu. Weird right? All tingly. I mean, I’ve run this game before a bunch of times, but it was different than that. Then again, it could also be this ice pick that’s been lodged in my skull for the last year. Sometimes it weirds my brain out. I should do something about that. Anyway…^So we have a little time so let me give you my puppy chow recipe. In a saucepan, melt the chocolate; add peanut butter and mix until smooth. Remove from heat, add cereal and stir until coated. Pour powdered sugar and cereal into large plastic bag and shake until well coated. Serve and enjoy! Anyway...^It’s been 30 seconds since the last time I checked so let’s see what’s happening on Instagram. Darn it! My pic from a day ago is still at 10 likes. It has to at least get to 11 or it looks terrible. I am literally dying. That’s it. I didn’t wanna do this, but I’m gonna like my own post. Alright, time to move on... ^Here’s a weird confession, but when I was a kid, I thought Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh was a female. I guess it’s because he was a gardener, and I thought all gardeners were women. Yeah, it’s pretty messed up but that’s what happens when you’re taught gender roles at a young age. Anyway…^I gotta say, this is a really fun dynamic. I’m really enjoying our back-and-forth so far. We have great chemistry. I mean, don’t get me wrong, we’re not as tight as the gals on The View. No way. Don’t be crazy. But we do have a similar dynamic to the gals on The Talk. I’m obviously the Sharon Osbourne of the group! Moving on... ^I’ve got the worst memory ever. I’ve buried so many bodies in this basement and I could not begin to tell you where they are. I mean, I used to mark each spot with like a popsicle stick or a little flag but then I got on this cleaning habit and I swept everything up and then I was like “Darnit! All that stuff was there for a reason!” Anyway…^(sfx: stomach gurgle) Oh, my tum tum’s upset. I’ve been eating a lot of farro lately. A lot of people are hung up on quinoa, but farro is where it’s at. Yeah, they’re both ancient grains and both a good source of protein, but only farro gives me that smug, self-satisfaction that lets me look down my nose at all you quinoa eaters. Anyhoo…^I saw a show on Discovery Channel the other day that said most short term memory starts to fade after just a few seconds. A few seconds! Yep. The longer you try to hold onto something you quickly memorized, the more your brain starts to misremember. Yep, yep, yep, yep. The brain, she is a funny thing. (Starts whistling) Oh, wait. You have a game to finish. ^The time has come...^Well, I have to hand it to you, you survived long enough for me to give you a fighting chance.^Okay, we’ve had our fun. I respect what you’ve done here so far, but it’s not quite over just yet.^Oh goody, you’ve survivied long enough to go to the final round. I hate not being able to use those questions.^Well, in the immortal words of Shania Twain… looks like we made it. Look how far we’ve come now baby. We mighta took the long way, but we knew we’d get here someday. Let’s do this!!^I’m impressed that I haven’t been able to kill you off… but you’ve got to give me just one more shot at it.^Okay, I’ll give it to you. You made it this far, but there’s one last obstacle to survive.^Wow. I wish I had one more big challenge to throw your way. Uh oh. I do.^I have no idea what’s making you tick but I’m gonna guess it’s a lot of anger and resentment. But there’s still one more hurdle you have to get though. ^We’ve gone through a lot on this journey. I wish you the best in this final leg I MEAN I hope I take your final leg.\\n^You couldn’t survive ONE question?!^You died on the FIRST question?!^You’re already dead?!

We’ll see how it goes for them.^Okay. Okay. Respectable work audience^Well… the audience is in it, but it could really go either way.^And the audience is doing okay-ish.^Hang in there, audience. You’re doing so-so-ish.^And like an audience at most improv shows, you’re just kinda there.^The audience, like a lot of employees, are doing pretty mediocre work remotely.^Hmm. The audience isn’t doing so great. But there’s time to catch up.^Looking at that score the audience might be dead already.^Geez, audience. You’re reminding me why I hate society.^Nice score, audience. FYI that was sarcasm.^And the audience is living down to my expectations.^Hey, audience, you’re an embarrassment to all uncaptured people.^jumpcut^Yikes^That’s really embarrassing for you.^Are you just trying to see if I say something funny if you die this early? Because I won’t.^Let’s pretend that didn’t happen.^That’s literally the worst you could possibly do at this. Wow.^I need to start abducting smart people.^Argh. This is a real inconvenience for me!^We were going to have oh so much fun together. Way to ruin it.^This was very anti-climactic for me.^I.... I’m done with you.^Oh, ouch! You just had to get through this one last question to make it to the final round, but then it all really went downhill.^Oh man. So close. So close. That was literally the last question you had to survive. (chuckles) I love it when that happens.^And you totally choked at the last possible moment. Classic!!^Oh, just in case you weren’t keeping track, yes, that was the last thing you had to survive to the final round and you… you know… didn’t.^(just laughs and laughs)^Wow. Brutal. So close and yet so far. Oh well.^You came so far, built up your confidence, only to fall flat on your face. Thank you for that. I really enjoyed your collapse^You were right there! Right there! Oh, that was delish!^Oh god. That was literally the best outcome for me. Thank you.^You almost got away from me, you little stinker! Almost.^The door was right there and you! You fell right on your face! Hahahaha^Whoopsie! You almost made it! Now you’re mine!^Ah crap, you were making some progress but you just couldn’t stay alive.^Ah ha ha ha. You thought you were maybe going to go all the way, but nope.^A totally respectable showing… I mean, before you messed up and ended up dead.^Oh man, I’ts actually kind of worse to almost do really well and then actually fail near the end, right? I bet you’re really feeling it.^Hey, sure, you didn’t make it to the end, but you made it a decent ways through the game. Don’t beat yourself up. That’s my job.^For a while there I thought maybe you were going to make it to the final round. But I guess I overestimated you. I won’t do that again.^You’re like the salmon swimming upstream and just before you got to the spawning pool, a bear snatched you. Sorry. Been watching a lot of nature docs, lately.^Ha! I bet you were feeling pretty good about yourself, huh? Well let that be a lesson: never have self-esteem.^You got pretty far, that’s something, right? You can brag to all your.... friends. Oh that’s right. You don’t have any. Bye now!^Well, you made it a pretty long way, but you didn’t make it to the end. You should’ve just saved us all time and died in the first round now that I think of it.^You had a nice little run. You should be proud of that. In fact, I’ll put it on your tombstone.^Hmm. Didn’t make it very far, huh?^Dead so soon?^You did NOT surive very long at all.^Not a great showing.^Well this didn’t take long.^And look who’s dead already.^Ooh. Somebody was quick to die.^And down ya go.^Have you considered cheating?  Maybe cheating is something you should do.^Maybe if you played with some friends some of them would do better at the game and you could get closer to the final round.^I’m not mad… I’m just… not sure I want to be around you anymore, you know?^Oh well, life goes on. I mean, not for you, but whatever.^What a sad way to end it all.^I kinda pity you.^I guess you have to be good at something and you’re good at being terrible.^Welp, just remember to walk into the light, little ghostie.^You know what would’ve helped? Friends. But nope. You’re a lone wolf and look where that got ya.^If you can survive two more questions, everyone goes to the final round.^If you can somehow survive these next two questions, I’ll give you a chance to escape during the final round.^If you can survive the next two questions, I think the final round should finally be ready to go.

(There is a different SFX for the cards coming up AFTER this first card.) [UPDATED 4.21.15]^This file plays at the beginning of ROUND TWO, when the text “ROUND TWO” comes onscreen. The second beat of it should hit when the logo gets to its largest size (so it’ll probably start just before you can see the logo).^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 1^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 2^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 3^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 4^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 5^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 6^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 7^Reveal Loop Round 2 Question 8^This SFX should play in ROUND THREE when the audience holds up the card with their votes for each answer. ^This file plays if a player receives the AUDIENCE FAVORITE text. It should start pretty much immediately after the “slap” part of QUIPSFX138.^This file is the stinger SFX for the beginning of ROUND THREE. It plays when the text for “ROUND THREE” comes on. To line it up properly, line the GONG SFX up with “The Last Lash!” text when it’s about a perfect square (before it stretches out to more of a rectangle). It’ll make sense. If not, ask me. [UPDATED 4.23.15]^This plays in the FINAL ROUND when the grid of cards appears onscreen (it should work for any number of cards, from 3 players to 8).^This file plays when a player gets a QUIPLASH and their talk balloon knocks the other offscreen (this used to be QUIPSFX22 but I’m cutting that up into smaller pieces).^This file plays when the “WINNER BONUS” stamp hits the screen during the scoring moments.^This is round 3, The LAST LASH. Points are tripled, and everyone gets the same ONE, SINGLE prompt this time.^And now, Round 3: The LAST LASH! Point values are TRIPLES... and you’ll all be answering the same prompt this time.^Welcome to The LAST LASH - the final round.

Fire up the scoreboard!^We’ve reached the end of Round 2. Let’s see what happened!^This file plays when a player has NO ANSWER on their card/talk balloon. So, in a pairing, on player has their response and the other’s says “No Answer.”^This file plays when the cards fly away toward the center of the screen (and disappear) after a pair has been voted on and scored.^This file plays during FINAL SCORES when the WINNER animates OFFSCREEN after the big reveal.^This is the sound when each player appears on the scoreboard, in front of their respective number.^This file plays during gameplay when a player gets a “Quiplash” and the QUIPLASH stamp slams onscreen.

Pick your favorite!^OK, pick your favorite!^This file plays in the LOBBY after the logo slides to the left and the room code appears. This will correspond with the blank player circles coming onscreen.^Write Loop Round 1^Write Loop Round 2^Write Loop Round 3^This file plays when the text for ROUND ONE and ROUND TWO flies away after the round intros. (It seems I failed to create a SFX for this.)^This file plays when the FIFTH player’s vote pops onto the talk bubble for which that player voted. (each player’s vote will have its own sound.)^This file plays when the timer appears onscreen in the upper left corner.^This file plays when the AUDIENCE (after voting) either SPLITS APART or MOVES TO ONE PLAYER’S SIDE.^This file plays when the black PERCENTAGE circle flies up and then down into the monsters’ mouth(s) (works for both Round 1 and Round 2). There will be an additional “monster eating” SFX that will play simultaneously.^This file plays in the LOBBY when the Quiplash logo slides to the left side of the screen and the ROOM CODE comes on.^It’s time for round 2, where all point values are doubled! That’s right, doubled!^It’s now time for Round 2. Everything is worth double! TWICE AS MUCH!^On to Round 2, where all points are doubled.

This file cuts off the drum roll (QUIPSFX122).^Background Loop^This file plays during the SCORING section and coincides with the small, black circle, that contains the percentages, comes onscreen. This was previously part of a larger SFX but that file has been cut up into smaller files to match up to animations better.^This file plays after the game is over, on the CREDITS screen when someone presses either “same players” or “new players.”^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 1^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 2^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 3^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 4^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 5^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 6^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 7^Reveal Loop Round 1 Question 8^This file plays when a card with a player’s answer zooms in to full screen. This same SFX will play individually for each of the two cards that are pitted against each other in the voting section.^This file plays when the black percentage circle is encircled by the jagged-y blue outline (signifying that they are the winner). This was previously part of a bigger SFX but is now an individual file that can be placed more accurately.^This file plays in the LOBBY when the “Everybody’s In” text comes ONSCREEN.^This file plays during the SCOREBOARD when the players’ scores tally up. The SLAP should hit at the exact moment when the numbers stop.^This file plays during the FINAL SCORES section and plays immediately after QUIPSFX123. It’s like, SLAM [short beat] THIS FILE.^This file plays when the player answer cards spin at the start of the “score” section and reveal the answer along with the name of the player who wrote the answer.^Our first prompt is...^The first prompt is...^First up...^First one...^Starting things off...^This file plays during a JINX moment when the percentage meters appear and “Jinx” flashes in the percentage meters.

[UPDATED4.20.15]^This file plays when the SECOND player’s vote pops onto the talk bubble for which that player voted. (each player’s vote will have its own sound.)^This file plays at the start of ROUND ONE when the “Round One” comes flying out from the center of the screen.^This file plays when the audience (the image of all the little heads) appears onscreen, sliding in from the center.^This file plays in the LOBBY when a player monster/name appears onscreen. There will be a “monster voice” that will play concurrently with this SFX (they’ll be delivered separately).^This is an updated SFX for the moment when the percentages inside the small black circle, spins up and then stops (during the scoring moments). The first part of the SFX is the numbers counting up and the “slap” part of the SFX should coincide with the numbers stopping. This was timed to Innis’ animation, so this should be the proper timing. ^This file plays when the SIXTH player’s vote pops onto the talk bubble for which that player voted. (each player’s vote will have its own sound.)^This file plays during Round One/Two intros when the subtext flies ONSCREEN (the lines of text beneath “Round One” or “Round Two” that explain the points).^This file plays each time a second elapses on the timer. It should correspond with the second number spinning.

Congratulations on navigating the highs and lows of the music industry. We\\'ll see you for the 20-year-reunion money grab. I mean, concert. [Unsubtitled]^Our whisper networks report your little outdoor shindig was juicy, flavorful, and neither over nor under-seasoned! When it comes to grilling, this family is well-done. You get the idea. [Unsubtitled]^Fins up, Devils! We heard a rumor that you made it through the day with even tans and chill vibes. You\\'ve even inspired your neighbors to make their own at-home ecosystems. Be sure to check out the deciduous forest in Margaret\\'s kitchen! [Unsubtitled]^Congratulations on a sock officially hopped. The dance was everything a dance is supposed to be: safe, awkward, a little mischievous, and most of all, sweaty. [Unsubtitled]^All reports indicate that the boss thoroughly enjoyed her evening. There just might be a promotion to Vice President of Important Things in your future. [Unsubtitled]^Rompo had a great time! They have told us your home is a great location for visiting monsters and demons. So get your guestroom ready, because we have a number of trickster spirits who need a place to crash. Literally. [Unsubtitled]^We all learned a valuable lesson this week. Just like real humans, you briefly fell for a popular activity, but quickly learned it was actually stupid. Just remember: Family togetherness is a \\'craze\\' that never goes out of style. [Unsubtitled]^We were mildly pleased to hear that the human realm was not destroyed by an asteroid. The town owes you a great debt, which they\\'re sure to repay with a little book of coupons for local businesses. [Unsubtitled]^Our network of moms has informed us that the student felt welcomed in your abode. Kudos on learning how people should get along, a lesson most of us learned in kindergarten. Oh, and hang on to that iced tea recipe! [Unsubtitled]  \\t\\t^Imagine the excitement downstairs when we saw one of our own plastered across the silver screen. You did remember to insert those subliminal messages we asked for, right? [Unsubtitled]^According to our sources, your family wasn\\'t TOO embarrassing and Riley said you were \\\"Beelze-Beautiful!\\\" A crush who is cute and can pun?! Jackpot! [Unsubtitled]^We were delighted to hear that Grandma Pazuzu’s 666th birthday party went off without a hitch. Celebrating the birthday of an annoying relative is a longstanding human tradition, much like office picnics and pretending to like homemade sweaters. [Unsubtitled]^Like a bat out of Hades...the bat returns to Hades! We\\'ll forgive you for using a little magic to dispel this cursed critter. From now on, though we encourage you to deal with pests the normal human way: dropping a large anvil on them. [Unsubtitled]^Despite some residual vine bruises, the lawn looks great. We\\'re pleased to announced you won the contest, and the grudging respect of your human peers! [Unsubtitled]^We were pleased to hear you\\'ve made your way into a higher tax bracket. Financial security is key to survival in the human world. But remember, money can\\'t buy happiness. Just kidding. It totally can! [Unsubtitled]^We were pleased to hear that you ended the phony ghost\\'s reign of terror. The human world has one less cranky old man to deal with. [Unsubtitled]^Thanks to your meticulous maintenance, the new car will be a cherished member of the family for years to come. At least until someone throws up in the back seat. [Unsubtitled]^According to the PTA, you got through the day and can now identify allegories in literature.  Now that\\'s a marketable skill! [Unsubtitled]^Super Tuesday says \\'Yes\\' to sundaes. Ice cream is legal once again and your newfound political power among the humans is the cherry on top. [Unsubtitled]^Refreshment achieved! You\\'re now officially the cool family with a pool. See you every day for the rest of summer! [Unsubtitled]^We were pleased to hear of your family\\'s speedy recovery. Working when you\\'re far too sick to work is a baffling but essential aspect of human culture. [Unsubtitled]^Good grades were rewarded, bad grades were addressed and all the Devils get an \\'A\\' for \\'Adequate Family Dynamics.\\' But also a real letter grade. \\t\\t^We heard that some \\\"Brava\\\"s and \\\"Bravissima\\\"s are in order! The show was a transcendent spectacle of modern theater. Thank you for bringing human entertainment some much-needed class. [Unsubtitled]^Our little birdies told us you appeared rested, relaxed, and recuperated the day after your mysterious \\'illnesses.\\' WE\\'RE certainly not suspicious. [Unsubtitled]^We were happy to hear that everyone got a whopping three and a half hours of sleep! You created an evening of minor misbehavior, caffeinated blood streams and late night screams. Just like every human sleep over. [Unsubtitled]^That\\'s one small step for suburbia, one giant leap for demonkind. And you did it all for your corporate sponsor, Poocho brand dog food! Poocho, the first dog food in space! [Unsubtitled]^Not only were we delighted with the time capsule you assembled, but the old one you dug up contained hundreds of shares in Pear Computers! We\\'re rich! We\\'ll send you a 2% finder\\'s fee. [Unsubtitled]^Well, it looks like the housing market is definitely RISING! Because you built a house high up. Get it? Anyway, it\\'s a very nice addition to your backyard. [Unsubtitled]^If Uncle Gorbo\\'s online reviews are any indication, he had a wonderful visit in your fair city. And since you managed to put up with him, he\\'s bound to show up again next year. Lucky you. [Unsubtitled]^We were happy to hear you took Paris by storm. Surviving a vacation with your immediate family is a critical human milestone. Don\\'t forget to bore your neighbors with the slides! [Unsubtitled]^[silence] [Unsubtitled]^Our industry scouts were pretty displeased with your performance. Did you try being good at music? Anyway, good luck with your solo careers. We can\\'t wait to use your CDs as fun kitschy coasters. [Unsubtitled]^Our secret grillers heard that your BBQ was overcrowded, sticky, and didn\\'t even provide a decent kebab option! Have fun rehabbing your ruined lawn, with a side of salmonella. [Unsubtitled]^Bad news: Some people just aren\\'t ready for the responsibility of \\\"finding their beach.\\\" Time to aloe those sunburns, and deal with that infestation of rat-crabs. [Unsubtitled]^We haven\\'t seen an event go that poorly since the Mask of the Red Death. We hope you enjoyed your car ride home together in silence, because no one will be signing your yearbooks for the next decade. [Unsubtitled]^The word around the water cooler is the boss had a painfully awful visit. The food was bad, and the company was even worse. Start shopping for snowshoes, because you\\'re about to be transferred to the Siberian branch. [Unsubtitled]^Cousin Rompo was a bit of a clawful, and we\\'re afraid to say you dropped the ball. The next time a visiting cryptid comes to town, we suggest spending more time responding to their unique habits and less time taking blurry photos of them for the album. [Unsubtitled]^Apparently, you were crushed between a \\\"Gronk\\\" and a hard place. We may have to relocate you to a town that doesn\\'t even know the meaning of the word \\\"trendy.\\\" Cleveland, here we come! [Unsubtitled]^Well, the Earth was destroyed. Hope you hadn\\'t gotten too attached! [Unsubtitled]^Tough luck, hosts. We\\'re hearing reports that your student didn\\'t feel enveloped into the love of your family unit at all! May every sip of refreshing iced tea sting with the memory of your failure.  [Unsubtitled]^Unfortunately, your 15 minutes of fame are up. Turns out a family of cartoon devils isn\\'t the viable entertainment property Jackbox Games thought it was. [Unsubtitled]^We predict you\\'ll continue seeing Riley for a bit, but never again speak of this awkward, awkward night. When you bring up the concept of parents, his eyes will glaze over as he stares into the middle distance. [Unsubtitled]^It has come to our attention that Grandma Pazuzu’s birthday was a total disaster. Our plants in her nursing home tell us she wouldn’t shut up about what a terrible time she had. Just a head’s up, don’t expect to see any of your names in the will. [Unsubtitled]^It appears this winged vile vermin now lives with you. It will burrow deep into your walls, lowering the resale value of your home, haunting your nightmares, and whispering very personal insults whenever you\\'re alone. [Unsubtitled]^According to satellite imagery, your overgrown yard has taken over the entire property. Impressive to biologists, but not to the contest judges. [Unsubtitled]^There\\'s more to life than money, but you need money to get it. If you can\\'t bring home the bacon, you\\'ll have to rely on the abstract concept of family love to fulfill you. And we all know how disappointing that will be. [Unsubtitled]^Not since the final season of Paradise Lost have we seen such an unsatisfying ending to a mystery. We specifically asked if you wanted the talking Cerberus that solves crime, but no, you had to have a cat. [Unsubtitled]^A car loses half its value when it\\'s driven off the lot, and all of its value when this family is in charge of it. [Unsubtitled]^Everyone embarrassed themselves and no one in this entire school will ever forget it. Ever! [Unsubtitled]^Due to your woeful lack of \\'electability,\\' ice cream remains illegal in this depressing town. Your family is drowning in the bitter taste of defeat and frozen yogurt. [Unsubtitled]^It appears that shoddy construction and poor social skills have foiled your mission of refreshment. Within minutes, the pool cracks, flooding everything in a three-block radius. On the bright side, the whole house is now a pool.  [Unsubtitled]^The extremely attractive doctor we sent to your home has diagnosed your family score as \\\"terminally crappy.\\\" Antibiotics won\\'t cure whatever\\'s keeping you all from working together. [Unsubtitled]^The family has failed, and will have to repeat these social interactions this summer. You can start by writing \\'I failed party games\\' 100 times on the nearest chalkboard. [Unsubtitled]^It seems that the dozens of theater critics we sent did NOT care for your \\\"production\\\". Because of your little stunt, the drama club was forced to disband completely. Are you happy? They\\'re a FOOTBALL school now! [Unsubtitled]^Smooth move, ex-lax. Not only were you caught in the act of shirking your responsibilities, you got sick for REAL from all the stress. [Unsubtitled]\\t^As the saying goes, \\'Hell is four children.\\' We shouldn\\'t be surprised that hosting eight was more than even the most durable devil could handle. Not only are the other parents suspicious of how sleep-deprived their kids are, they could have sworn they were much less \\'possessed by evil\\' when they dropped them off. [Unsubtitled]^Our spies at NASA tell us the launch was a dismal failure. If you\\'d taken your mission seriously, you might have actually left the atmosphere. We\\'ve seen better training in celebrity yoga videos. [Unsubtitled]^It appears you have twice as much garbage as before, holes all over your backyard, and something you dug up died decades ago. [Unsubtitled]^Your neighbors have reported a loud crash in the middle of the night. Looks like your new project made like a tree and timbered. In the future, you may want to use stronger building materials than duct tape and minimum effort. [Unsubtitled]^It\\'s hard to tell who had a worse time, you or Uncle Gorbo. He won\\'t be staying with you again anytime soon. And while that may sound nice, you can kiss Aunt Flemm\\'s famous bloodberry pies goodbye. [Unsubtitled]^Paris is so beautiful this time of year. Probably. You\\'ll never know because poor planning caused you to miss your flight. [Unsubtitled]^Like generations of bored families before them, the Devils have decided to form a folk-rock band. It\\'s time to rock and/or roll! [Unsubtitled]^Summer\\'s here and it\\'s time for a relaxing barbeque with the neighbors. Can the family get through a normal human grillout without inviting the whole neighborhood, or will they be raked over the coals? [Unsubtitled]^The air conditioning\\'s out and the family is 4000 miles from the nearest coast. So they decide to have an at-home beach day. Can they stay on island time and still knock out the chores?  [Unsubtitled]^It\\'s time for the Spring Dance! Be there or be shunned for the rest of your high school career. [Unsubtitled]^The boss is coming over for dinner and a juicy promotion hangs in the balance. The family has to be on their best behavior to get on the bigwig\\'s good side. [Unsubtitled]^Your cousin Rompo wrote us and said they wanted to visit you. They\\'ve even offered to help with your daily duties! I\\'m sure rumors of them being a precocious troublemaker are completely unfounded.  [Unsubtitled]^Dire News! There\\'s a new teen craze called \\'gronking\\' which is an activity so obscene and rebellious we can\\'t even describe it here. In this very special episode, the family must keep the kids from falling prey to this tantalizing trend while still respecting their autonomy. [Unsubtitled]^While studying astronomy, the youngest member of the house discovers a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. Can the family stop it in time, and still get through their daily chores? [Unsubtitled]^An exchange student from Pearly Gates, Iowa is staying with the family for the weekend. Try to make them feel at home, won\\'t you? [Unsubtitled]^Hollywood has come to our tiny town. A big budget movie is being shot nearby and the family is determined to get a taste of fame. [Unsubtitled]^Love is in the air! Everyone\\'s favorite teenage hellspawn is bringing home their very first significant other. And they\\'re human! It\\'s up to the family to make sure the date goes off without a hitch. [Unsubtitled]^It’s Grandma Pazuzu’s 666th birthday, and even though she’s a three-headed pain demon who no one likes, the family is throwing her a party. [Unsubtitled]^Bad News! The family has a tiny rodent problem. And by \\\"tiny rodent\\\" we mean \\\"demonic bat.\\\" It seems the critter escaped from the underworld and is hidden somewhere in the house. Good luck! [Unsubtitled]^It\\'s time for the annual neighborhood \\\"Lawn-o-Rama.\\\" Who will earn regard for their starred yard, and who will be discarded with the marred chard?\\t\\t [Unsubtitled]^Money makes the world go round, and the family wants more of it. This week, everyone does whatever they can to get a job, get a raise, or luck their way into some cash. [Unsubtitled]^The neighborhood is in suspense after multiple reports of a ghostly old sea captain haunting the streets at night. It\\'s up to the family to solve this mystery. Mostly because no one else wants to. [Unsubtitled]^The family has purchased a brand new car and everyone\\'s in love with it. But can it survive its first week at the Devils residence? [Unsubtitled]^The Devils enroll the kids in the town\\'s fancy new school. Can they turn this Montessori into a MONSTERSORI? [Unsubtitled]^In a misguided show of public health, the town has declared all ice cream illegal. This travesty of justice draws the family into local politics, just in time for the upcoming City Council race. [Unsubtitled]^The days are getting hotter, so our fire-fueled family tries to cool down via a new backyard pool. Will they have fun in the sun, or have a fit in the money pit? [Unsubtitled]^Everyone\\'s home sick with the demon pox, but that doesn\\'t mean the chores stop coming. Can the family keep the house running without running their health into the ground? [Unsubtitled]^Report cards are in the mail. Some are good Some are bad. Can the family survive these academic ups and downs? [Unsubtitled]^The elementary school is putting on a production of \\\"A Streetcar Named \\\"Streetcar #124B.\\\" Will the family be the stars of the show, or will they be forced to \\\"turn off the dark\\\"? [Unsubtitled]^It\\'s been a long couple of months, so everyone in the family decides to have their own little skip day. Will they enjoy a single moment of privacy for once in their lives? [Unsubtitled]^The family\\'s youngest child is hosting their first sleepover. Can they manage the pure anarchy of 8 children with the cover darkness? This is an overnight challenge, so we\\'ll be back in the morning to see how you did. [Unsubtitled]^From the underworld to outer space, the family is going where no devil has gone before when they\\'re chosen to be launched into orbit. [Unsubtitled]^Time capsules help your future self remember the past by putting your past interests in the tube for the future. This week, the family makes themselves a present they won\\'t get to open for 15 years.\\t [Unsubtitled]^The family has decided to build a treehouse in the backyard. Can they construct an arboreal abode without uprooting their regular routine? [Unsubtitled]^Beloved Uncle Gorbo is in town! The only problem is he\\'s known for overstaying his welcome and annoying the heck out of everyone. Can the family entertain their guest without losing their temper? [Unsubtitled]^The family has won a luxurious Paris vacation! There\\'s just one catch: They only have a week to prepare for the trip. [Unsubtitled]^that means one of the family has given into their devilish nature. A task to stop them will appear on your device, but you have to act fast.^Another selfish act has begun. If I were you, I’d grab the task to stop it. Or just publicly shame the perpetrator. As my study of mortals has taught me, a little guilt goes a long way.\\n^Didn\\'t learn your lesson from last time? Work together to end this emergency. And next time, stop this family member before they complete their selfish tasks.^These emergencies keep happening because people are being selfish. And you\\'re all losing points each time!

Fair warning, though: you will miss me.^Think you know what you\\'re doing? You can turn off tutorials in the settings menu. I\\'ll still be silently judging you.^Just FYI, if you don\\'t need so many reminders, you can turn off tutorials in the settings menu.^Did I forget to tell you to do BETTER than last time? I thought that was implied.^Isn\\'t it annoying when you fail in a video game, and the game mentions you can reduce the difficulty in the Settings Menu? I HATE that.

Let\\'s try that again.^How about a do-over?^Let\\'s take it back to square one, hm?^If you don\\'t reach this goal, you risk failing the week. And there is NO RETRYING on the final day.^Hello?

Hurry up and make a decision or I\\'ll cancel the mission.^[Forced CC] They came from down below^[Forced CC] This daily torture\\'s cruel^[Forced CC] However, they’re worth a ton of points to those devilish enough to get away with them. Just saying...^[Forced CC] Complete these tasks and you’ll earn points for the Family Score. Keeping the Family Score high is your number one priority!^[Forced CC] Last thing, tasks with this symbol are selfish tasks. They don’t help the family at all, and doing too many causes an emergency that can be catastrophic to the family score. ^[Forced CC] You’re going to see a list of tasks appear on your device. You know, “mow the lawn,” “muck out the gutters,” “stand in the garage and sigh.” These are normal chores humans do every day. No one knows why.^[Forced CC] Pitchforks in the pool (impropriety!)^[Forced CC] But, there’s also a prize for the individual that earns the most points.

Vergeuden wir keine Zeit.^Bevor wir anfangen, lasst uns einen Moment der Wärme unserer gegenseitigen Anwesenheit genießen… okay, das reicht.^Eine geheimnisvolle, alte Frau hat mir einmal erzählt, dass ich eine Gruppe Fremder treffen würde, die mein Leben verändern werden. Also haltet die Augen nach denen offen. Und bis dahin spielen wir.^Ich hoffe, ihr habt alle eure Quiphosen an. Lasst uns spielen.^Das wird eine denkwürdige Runde. Ich kann\\'s spüren.^Nur zur Erinnerung: Jeder Spieler, der dabei erwischt wird, Quip-verbesserndes Doping zu betreiben, wird mit einem Sternchen neben seinem Namen markiert.^Ihr erinnert euch also alle an eure Namen. Dann sollte der Rest des Spiels nicht allzu schwer werden.^Schöne Gruppe. Schöne Gruppe. Ich hoffe nur, dass wir hinterher alle noch Freunde sind.^Tolle Namen. Ist das Niederländisch? Super. Los geht\\'s.^Das Tolle an einer neuen Spielrunde ist, dass ihr euch im Moment alle den ersten Platz teilt. Und den letzten.^Dann sind ja alle da. Ich drück mal auf den großen, roten LOS-Knopf.^Okay, lasst uns schnell loslegen. Ich verpasse bestimmt gerade was Cooles auf Snapchat.^So eine Truppe sieht man nicht alle Tage. Zum Glück.^Leute, ich will es nicht beschreien, aber ich glaube, hier werden heute ein paar Leben verändert.^Ich hoffe, ihr benutzt alle euren echten, vollen Namen. Dieses Spiel fließt nämlich in eure Schufa-Bewertung ein.^Hey, hübschen Raum haben wir heute. Die Leute, die drinsitzen, könnten noch etwas hübscher sein, aber der Raum selber ist wunderschön.^Nette Namen. Wenn mein Capybara endlich wirft, benenne ich die Jungen nach euch.^Nur zur Vorwarnung, ich werde eure besten Quips später bei meiner Comedy-Nummer verwenden.^Ich weiß schon, dass ich gleich sehr viel über euch erfahren werde. Und ich hab meinen Frieden damit geschlossen.^Von euch hat vermutlich keiner einen wissenschaftlichen Taschenrechner, oder? Nein? Dann muss ich die Punkte heute wohl von Hand ausrechnen.^Schaut euch eure Mitspieler gut an. Das sind eure Feinde. Macht sie fertig.^Ich fühle mich euch so nahe, Leute. Lasst uns einen Pakt schließen, dass wir uns in zehn Jahren hier wieder treffen und übers Leben reden.^Hey, alle meine Lieblingsmenschen! Ich würde wirklich ALLES für euch tun, Leute. Sogar helfen, eine Leiche zu beseitigen! Haha! Das würdet ihr doch auch für mich tun, oder? Ich stecke da nämlich in einigen Schwierigkeiten. Ach, wisst ihr was? Vergesst das wieder. Fangen wir an.^So, ich will, dass ihr euch alle tadellos benehmt. Sonst dreh ich um und wir fahren zurück.^Nur einer von euch kann gewinnen, aber ihr alle verdient meinen Respekt. Na ja, die meisten von euch.^Ihr sollt wissen, dass ich vielleicht nicht alle eure Quips mag, aber ich werde bis aufs Blut dafür kämpfen, dass ihr sie quippen dürft. Oder zumindest eine Online-Petition dafür unterschreiben.^So, so. Ausnahmsweise sind alle mal pünktlich. Ihr wisst genau, wen ich meine. Fangen wir an.^Erstmal möchte ich was zu den Gerüchten klarstellen. SEHR wenige Spieler sind unter meiner Aufsicht gestorben. Und die, die gestorben sind, hatten es alle verdient.^Ich glaube, wir sind gerade genug Leute, um eine Laola zu machen. Aber lassen wir\\'s lieber.^Mit euch kann ich arbeiten. Legen wir los.^Gracias por uniros a la fiesta. Luego le pediré a alguno de vosotros que vaya a por hielo.^¿Estáis cómodos? Estupendo.^Que nadie se sienta incómodo, pero mi amor platónico está en la sala. Intentad no flipar demasiado.^Espero que estéis listos porque esto no hay quien lo pare ya.^¿Ya estáis todos? En fin, nos conformaremos con lo que hay.^Buen grupo, sí señor. Al menos, a juzgar por los nombres.^Quiero que os soltéis la melena y os divirtáis. Y sed ingeniosos.^No tiene más misterio.^Por cierto, os he nombrado herederos de todas mis deudas.^Eh, ¿qué vais a hacer después de la partida? Tenéis mi número, ¿verdad? Estupendo.^Noto mucha ira contenida en este grupo. Sobre todo por mi parte. ¡Así que cerrad el pico y empecemos de una vez!^Ninguno de vosotros lleva marcapasos, ¿verdad? Tranquis, no pasa nada.^¿Listos para el despegue? Muy bien, vamos allá.^¿Esos son los nombres que habéis elegido? Sobre gustos...^Se me ha ocurrido una regla mnemotécnica para recordar vuestros nombres, pero suena fatal. Empezamos.^Creo que ya sé quién es el graciosillo de este grupo. Vamos allá.^Si queréis que pare, decid la palabra secreta. Comenzamos.^En serio, no hace falta que hagáis gracias para impresionarme. No espero nada de vosotros.^Quiero que deis el 110 %. He apostado mucha pasta por vosotros.^Vale, espero que hayáis terminado de calentar, porque esto empieza ya.^Me alegro de veros. No perdamos más tiempo.^Antes de empezar, quiero que dediquéis un momento a disfrutar de la calidez de vuestra mutua compañía y... Vale, ya basta.^Una anciana misteriosa me dijo que un grupo de desconocidos me cambiaría la vida. Avisadme si los veis. Mientras tanto, vamos a jugar.^Espero que llevéis puesto el tanga de los zascas. Hora de jugar.^Esta partida va a hacer historia. Lo presiento.^Aviso: si pillo a algún jugador dopándose para que se le ocurran más zascas, le pongo un asterisco en el expediente.^Veo que recordáis vuestros nombres. Creo que esto os resultará pan comido.^Buen grupo, Buen grupo, A ver lo que os dura la amistad.^Buenos nombres. ¿Eso es arameo? Genial. Vamos a ello.^Lo bueno de empezar una nueva partida es que todos vais los primeros. Y los últimos.^Veo que ya está toda la cuadrilla. Voy a pulsar el botón rojo de ignición.^Venga, que es para hoy. Seguro que me estoy perdiendo algo bueno en Snapchat.^Un grupo como este no se ve todos los días. Gracias al cielo.^No quiero ser gafe, pero creo que hoy vamos a cambiarle la vida a mucha gente.^Espero que hayáis usado vuestros nombres reales, porque esto aparecerá en la declaración de la renta.^Eh, me gusta esa sala. La gente no tanto, pero la sala es una preciosidad.^Buenos nombres. Cuando mi ornitorrinco salga de cuentas, llamaré así a los peques.^Me reservo el derecho a reciclar vuestros zascas en mi monólogo de esta noche.^Creo que hoy voy a aprender mucho de vosotros. Para bien o para mal.^¿Alguno de los presentes tiene una calculadora científica de sobra? ¿No? Bueno, llevaré la puntuación con un ábaco.^Mirad bien a los demás jugadores. Son vuestros enemigos. A por ellos.^Siento que se ha creado un vínculo entre nosotros. Hagamos un pacto y reunámonos aquí dentro de diez años para hablar de la vida.^¡Anda, mis supercolegas! Haría lo que fuera por vosotros. ¡Incluso ayudaros a deshaceros de un cadáver! ¡Ja, ja! Lo haríais por mí, ¿verdad? Porque tengo que pediros un favor. Luego os cuento. Empezamos.^Portaos bien, ¿entendido? No quiero tener que echar a nadie.^Solo uno será el ganador, pero os respeto a todos por igual. Bueno, a casi todos.^Puede que no me hagan gracia todos vuestros zascas, pero defenderé vuestro derecho a expresarlos con mi vida. Bueno, firmaré una petición online y ya.^No me fastidies. Veo que, por una vez, todo el mundo ha llegado a su hora. No quiero mirar a nadie. Comencemos.^En primer lugar, me gustaría desmentir unos rumores. Muy pocos jugadores han muerto en este concurso. Y los que han muerto se lo merecían.^Creo que tenemos gente suficiente para hacer la ola, pero no os molestéis.^Así está bien.

[category=host]^Icon 1^Each version should be associated with the specific Player Icon listed in the Tag column and fire when: Player joins (which will eventually involve the player choosing their icon, I’m assuming); Player has submitted writing content, and other instances that will be specified in JIRA. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Icon 2^New Version [category=sfx][unduckable]^Icon 3^Icon 4^Icon 5^Icon 6^Icon 7^Icon 8^Gene^Hello [category=sfx][unduckable]^[category=ambient][exclusive][ignore-input][loop]Along with SFX_005, should fire when the desktop first appears. Maybe fade it out over 1-2 sec when SFX_007 (mouse-click of the STI app) fires. [category=sfx]^To play as the STI “app” icon is clicked on [category=sfx]^The wipe sound for the Login browser window’s appearance [category=sfx]^Should fire when the desktop first appears [category=sfx]^This should fire ALONG WITH SFX_013 when the VIP joins [category=sfx]^Fires when the window labelled “welcome to Survive the Internet” wipes on [category=sfx]^Fires as the Play / Settings / Leaderboard / back to Pack text wipes onto the Welcome browser window [category=sfx]^Should fire as the Play option highlights by default in the Welcome browser, AND as the player scrolls to one of the other options (Settings, Leaderboard, or back to Pack). [category=sfx]^[ignore-input]Fires when “play” is clicked on in the Welcome browser window. [category=sfx][unduckable]^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]Timing subject to change, of course, but for now I’d like this to start along with SFX_018, the logo smash on sfx. It should loop the last bit of text instructions wipes off - when that sfx (021) fires for the last time this mus should start to fade out, maybe over 1-2 sec. ^This is a wipe for the entrance of the leaderboard. Right now it’s timed to start before the actual leaderboard appears -- it should start the moment when the purple browser window moves (starts to contract as it disappears) just before that [category=sfx]^After all content has been entered, a purple browser screen wipes on (which houses all the content reveals). This should fire as it wipes on. [category=sfx]^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]The timing and possibly the music itself will probably change, but for now this should fire at the same time as SFX_005 - when the “desktop” first appears. It should loop until SFX_017 fires (the wipeoff for the lobby windows) - probably to fade out over 2-3 sec.^This should fire when the twist text, or the troll text, wipes on. For eg, “Toddler Mike Bilder hula hoops like a champ!” (in response to “I don’t like him” [category=sfx][unduckable]^This should fire when the first instance of all content windows wipe on at the end of a “question.” In the 3/10/17 mov eg, there were four windows that wiped on. This sound might need to be attached to ea individual wipeon eventually, but my plan is to only have it fire with the first instance and cover all of them entering. [category=sfx][unduckable]^To fire each time the text of the instructions (not the number 1, 2 or 3, but the “Answer the question” / “Take another player’s words out of context” / “Vote on who looks the worst” text) starts to wipe onscreen. It’s timed to when the text is first visible on the righthand side of the screen. [category=sfx][unduckable]^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]Should start as the first reveal window (ie, the first window that contains player submitted writing content) wipes on (which is SFX_026). It should loop until after the leaderboard comes and goes and the blue browser window wipes back on. (The accompanying sfx is 023.) It should fade out over maybe a second. At which point the theme loop (MUS002) could start up again as in the beginning and we repeat the whole process again.^Assuming the timing of the vote awarding won’t change... Vers 1 should fire when all of the First Votes are received (ie, the first ‘round’ of votes).  [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires as the second ‘round’ of votes is rewarded [original design was this version firing for any additional ‘rounds’ of voting after the first ‘round’] [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires as the third ‘round’ of votes is awarded [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires as the fourth ‘round’ of votes is awarded [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires as the fifth ‘round’ of votes is awarded [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires as the sixth ‘round’ of votes is awarded [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires as the seventh/last ‘round’ of votes is awarded [category=sfx][unduckable]^Should fire on the first instance of the multiple content windows wiping offscreen; ie, this should cover all instances but be attached to first movement. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Should fire when a window that reveals written content first wipes on - for eg, the Online Video window containing the comment “I don’t like him”. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Fires whenever the player icons fade a bit, to signal the beginning of a writing phase [category=sfx]^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]This music should start when the writing period begins (right now it would fire at the same time as SFX_022) and start to fade out (over, say, 1 sec) when the last player has submitted the last bit of content before the answers are revealed.^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]^To fire [ALONG WITH 013 if it happens simultaneously] when the “Press ‘Everybody’s In’ to start the game” text appears [category=sfx]^A wipe when the leaderboard flies offscreen [category=sfx]^To fire when the 3... 2... 1... countdown text first appears onscreen [category=sfx]^Should fire when the STI logo wipes off (prior to the “1” of the instructions series of text wiping on) [category=sfx]^Fires whenever a reveal window falls offscreen [category=sfx]^This is the original SFX_011, which was replaced  - this should fire when selecting Settings, Leaderboard or Back to Pack - anything other than Play in the Options window [category=sfx][unduckable]^To fire for each Player Icon when it’s part of an en masse wipeon - for eg, after a writing phase has ended -- as opposed to individual content submission sfx (SFX_013) [category=sfx]^Should play whenever a Setting is turned OFF: Fullscreen Mode, Audience, Family Friendly, Requires Twitch, Start Game from Controller, or Manual Censoring--ALSO use when ESC is chosen in any of these Options screens [category=sfx]^sound should play when toggling between “twitch stats” and “session stats” on the Leaderboard screen [category=sfx]^Should play whenever a Setting is turned on: Fullscreen Mode, Audience, Family Friendly, Requires Twitch, Start Game from Controller, or Manual Censoring. [category=sfx]^Should play each time the vol is adjusted, at a vol either 3 dB (?) higher or lower than the previous setting.^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]Spencer would like to try having the writing of the “twist” or “hack” to have different music than the “survey” or “straight” writing. This event would randomly fire one of the versions during the twist writing phase.^[category=music][ignore-input][exclusive][loop]This vers used to be the Reveal Loop^Per Dave’s mockup 3/31/17, this is the sound to fire when the little “-30” or whatever appears on the right side of a player’s score, telling us how much is about to be deducted [category=sfx]^To fire as the player’s score winds down. Hopefully the animation stays about the same length regardless of the amount of change to the score. [category=sfx]^Version 1: Long [Should fire on first movement of the playername that’s gonna fall. For now there’s only Long and Short. Long sounds better, but if it looks ridiculous try Vers 2 as a backup plan.] [category=sfx]^Version 2: Short [category=sfx]^To randomly fire along w/ each instance of the glass-crack animation, after the thumbs’downs have punched thru the “glass” [category=sfx]^New Version [category=sfx]^Tutorial: To fire as Phone 2 (on the right) moves forward. [category=sfx][unduckable]^This is a wipeon sfx for the Best Burn wipe on (the big pic of the icon w/ the horns). Choose one of these versions at random.

[category=sfx][unduckable]^The very first thing that happens in the Tutorial (as of 4/5) is a phone wipes on. This sfx should accompany that movement. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Tutorial: To fire when the text “Twist your opponent’s words” wipes on. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Tutorial: To fire as both phones wipe offscreen (sound should play once, sound will cover both movements). [category=sfx][unduckable]^Tutorial: To fire as Phone 1 (on the left) moves forward. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Tutorial: To fire as the [text] answer to the example survey question wipes on the phone.

This sound should accompany the movement. [category=sfx]^Should fire when the timer hits 10 sec left, and for 9 sec, 8 sec etc. through 1 sec remaining.

Should start right w/ the beginning of the visual, which starts right after the “you win” visual finishes looping. [category=sfx][unduckable]^4th and final part of the Lose bumper. Should fire as the crack first starts to close. [category=sfx][unduckable]^Part 3 of the Lose bumper - should fire on first movement of the player icon - it’s the scream as it goes into the crack in the Earth.

No one’ll be painting over that tomorrow, I promise. [category=host]^Some days I love my job. Jury’s still out on today. [category=host]^It’s not the best art I’ve seen, but it’s by far the most recent. [category=host]^We can thank democracy for this. [category=host]^What have we done here? [category=host]^Well, it’s out in the universe now. We just have to own it. [category=host]^Ya know, maybe it’s less about the painting, and more about the time we had together. [category=host]^Oooh! I want a small version for my desk [category=host]^Oh. That’s more...STRIKING than I expected. [category=host]^Boy, it sure is different seeing it that big, huh? Well....

Whatever kind of head you want is probably fine. [category=host] [unduckable]^Well, I guess we\\'re drawing an animal. For starters, let\\'s add a head to this body and we\\'ll go from there.

Get those fingers ready. ^You know, if you told me five minutes ago there’d be a group of three playing... I’d probably believe you. ^Looks like we have three players.

You’re sleek and compact.^And we\\'ve got a nice, cozy group of three. Oh, the memories we’ll make.^If you don\\'t hit send on your drawing in the next 30 seconds or so, it\\'ll be lost.

Maybe you should just hit send now so you don\\'t take too long and miss your chance.^30 seconds left y\\'all, let\\'s wrap it up.

You can’t just run off with that thing.[category=host]^I just realized I might lose my bomb.[category=host]^WIG^You can\\'t leave me, Mother![category=host]^You might win this, Mother! [category=host]^Oh Mother, I\\'m conflicted about you possibly escaping! [category=host]^HAT^Who are you kidding?! Don\\'t let him escape![category=host]^Ugh! Don\\'t let my DAD win! [category=host]^I\\'m super peeved that my Dad might win! [category=host]^KNIFE^Hey wait up! I want your digits![category=host]^Hey, are you going to run off with my knife?

[category=host]^Now it\\'s your turn to play.[category=host]^Pick a chalice already![category=host]^Hmm.... That one was too easy.[category=host]^Ugh! I gotta get some harder questions. [category=host]^A lot of lucky guesses. [category=host]^Kind of a gimmie. [category=host]^I\\'m going too easy on you. [category=host]^Hmm, you\\'re better than I thought. [category=host]^Let’s just call that a fluke. [category=host]^Not what I had in mind... [category=host]^Some of you didn’t use your poison pellet. So I’ll have to add a few of my own.[category=host]^It sounds like we didn\\'t get everyone\\'s poison pellets in the chalices. I guess I\\'ll have to add my own. [category=host]^2^There are 2 chalices.[category=host]^3^There are 3 chalices.[category=host]^4^There are 4 chalices.[category=host]^5^There are 5 chalices.[category=host]^6^There are 6 chalices.[category=host]^7^There are 7 chalices.[category=host]^8^There are 8 chalices.[category=host]^Come on Ghosts! Get it together!! [category=host]^Don\\'t disappoint me, Ghosts. Go faster. [category=host]^Yeah, this is turning into a serious lead. [category=host]^Hmm. Kind of running away with it. [category=host]^It\\'s not too late to close this gap. [category=host]^Don\\'t let the player escape with a bomb! They\\'re a danger to society! [category=host]^Are you keeping your distance because they have a bomb? Come on! You\\'re ghosts! [category=host]^A strong lead for the player with the bomb. [category=host]^Oh no! Don\\'t leave me mother! [category=host]^I hope you win, Mother! [category=host]^Up there in the lead? Yeah! That’s my MOM! [category=host]^You’re so close Mother, you can do this. [category=host]^My dad is getting away! [category=host]^No, Father! I can’t let you win![category=host]^I can’t believe my dad is dominating this game. Ugh! My life sucks![category=host]^Isn’t anybody going to try to stop my dad?![category=host]^Is everyone afraid of the knife? Is that what’s going on?[category=host]^Oh, I get it. Everyone wants to stay BEHIND the person with the knife.[category=host]^I wish I had the confidence of someone running with a knife. [category=host]^A powerful lead for the knife-wielder. [category=host]^Here’s EVERYONE\\'S next question:[category=host]^You\\'re not supposed to ALL die before the final round is ready! [category=host]^Aw crap! You ALL died too early. Bummer. [category=host]^The final round isn\\'t ready yet! You\\'re not ALL supposed to die before that! [category=host]^You\\'re ALL dead already? What the heck, guys! [category=host]^I told you what would happen![category=host]^All you needed to do was cut off a finger! Sheesh! [category=host]^I hate passive people. [category=host]^I warned you. [category=host]^Only a ghost got it wrong...[category=host]^Yikes! There\\'s a g-g-g-g-ghost right behind you!! [category=host]^That ghost can smell your lifeforce. [category=host]^Don\\'t look back because there\\'s a ghost RIGHT THERE. [category=host]^You can\\'t outrun that ghost forever. [category=host]^This is so exciting that I\\'M gonna explode![category=host]^Mother, you\\'re in danger! [category=host]^Mother! They’re right behind you![category=host]^What are you, my step dad!? You’re getting too close to my Mom![category=host]^Beware of the ghosts, Papa![category=host]^They’re getting real close, Father![category=host]^(self pleased) Watch out for ghosts, Father![category=host]^That player has a knife! Get em![category=host]^A knife can\\'t save you from ghosts. [category=host]^I’m going to give you a category...[category=host][2]^Do as much math as you can before time runs out. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Aw crap. You didn\\'t fail. [category=host]^I should have made that harder. [category=host]^Hmm. My mistake for not realizing you\\'d be minimally competent at math. [category=host]^You’re just lucky I didn’t make you do algebra. [category=host]^I gotta get some harder math problems. [category=host]^Oh, you’re one of those people, huh? [category=host]^Next time I should use imaginary numbers. [category=host]^Wow, you\\'re just like the guy from “A Beautiful Mind.\\\" [category=host]^How did you beat math?  Math always wins. [category=host]^Hold on! I had to watch math AND you didn’t die?! That’s the worst. [category=host]^I never thought math would fail me, but it did. [category=host]^Let\\'s go! [category=host]^The ghosts are catching uppppppp...[category=host][3]^Those ghosts are closing in on ya. [category=host]^I don\\'t know if you can outrun those ghosts. [category=host]^Here come the ghosts. [category=host]^Will the ghosts kill you before you blow up? Super fun! [category=host]^That bomb must be slowing you down. [category=host]^Run Mommy! The ghosts are gonna get you! [category=host]^Uh oh, the ghosts are catching up, Mom! [category=host]^It\\'s okay Mother, the ghosts are only catching up a little bit. [category=host]^Catch my father! Make him suffer! [category=host]^Yes. Yes. Catch my Father. [category=host]^The ghosts want all of your fingers![category=host]^I\\'ll have you know, I had to get a reverse mortgage on the family murder hotel to fund all the money I\\'m giving out this game. (beat) So I hope you appreciate it. [category=host]^You know this elevator was first installed in the hotel back in 19... something... something. I can\\'t remember the number. There\\'s a plaque somewhere. [category=host]^According to family legend, before they installed this elevator, no human had ever been above the third floor. Weird, huh? [category=host]^Hosting my games in this old hotel is just a temporary thing, you know. I hope to one day kill people at a summer camp. [category=host]^If I had to guess I get my serial killer tendencies from both sides of my family... but I don\\'t know where I got my desire for the spotlight. Certainly not my dad! [category=host]^If I really want to make things happen for myself I should really be killing people in New York or LA. This is just a temporary thing for me. [category=host]^When I was growing up in this hotel, the internet wasn\\'t really a thing yet. Which made it easier to get away with murder. But harder to become a social media influencer. So, it all evened out.[category=host]^If a ghost catches up with you they will steal your life force! Then THEY can escape and win the game.[category=host]^If a ghost catches you they\\'ll steal your life force! Then they can try to escape and win the game. [category=host]^I want to show you something.[category=host]^Come with me. [category=host]^Follow me. [category=host]^It\\'s time. [category=host]^Time for consequences. [category=host]^The time has come...[category=host]^Spin that thing! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Spin it! It\\'s FUUUUN! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Give it a spin. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^See, that wasn\\'t so bad. [category=host]^Gram Gram would have been so proud of you. [category=host]^Okay, cool. Finger cutting done. [category=host]^The darkness approaches.[category=host]^Mmm! Tasty.[category=host]^Yum yum. [category=host]^Yummy.  [category=host]^Mmmm-mmmm. [category=host]^Slurp slurp. [category=host]^Delish. [category=host]^Ah! That\\'s the good stuff! [category=host]^Ah! Goes down smooth. [category=host]^Refreshing. [category=host]^Salud! [category=host]^That hits the spot!

[category=host]^Well, you\\'d be closer to the exit if you\\'d gotten either of those right. [category=host]^Time\\'s running out![category=host]^Time\\'s almost up! [category=host]^Almost out of time! [category=host]^Okay, fine! I\\'ll spin it for you. [category=host]^Ugh. I\\'ll spin it for you. [category=host]^Too lazy to push one button?! Respect. I\\'ll push it for you. [category=host]^Oh, did I mention that all the other ghosts get to play too![category=host]^Plot twist! All the ghosts get to play too! [category=host]^Oh wait, did you think it was going to be just you? Aww... that\\'s cute![category=host]^But get this, all ghosts get to play too![category=host]^Ah, but it\\'s not just you. [category=host]^But you\\'re not alone in here. [category=host]^But wait, there\\'s more. [category=host]^Welcome back to the Murder Hotel. We made zero improvements since your last stay. [category=host]^Checking in again? You should join our Murder Hotel Rewards Program and eventually get discounts on the hotel Wi-Fi. [category=host]^You won’t believe this! But I just murdered a group that looked exactly like you… weird![category=host]^You want to stay again!? And people say I’m insane! ...and I am!  [category=host]^I’m glad you’re staying another night! Our hotel rewards loyalty but punishes getting trivia questions wrong.  [category=host]^I see you’re checking in with our sequel package. The rooms are all the same… and so is everything else, I guess. It’s still fun, though.[category=host]^Ah, more guest already? Oh shoot... I didn’t have time to wash the towels.[category=host]^Whoa, deja vu. I could’ve sworn I just murdered you… [category=host]^Just you again?  Couldn’t get any big names for the sequel? Ugh... Oh well.[category=host]^Welcome back.  Unfortunately the Wi-Fi\\'s not working, but don\\'t worry, the murder stuff is still happening.[category=host]^(panting) Oh, you’re back! Good timing -- I just finished digging more graves in the cellar. ...I am out of shape... [category=host]^Welcome back! Remember, breakfast is 6am to 9:30. The pool’s open \\'til 11pm. And, of course, murder is 24 hours. [category=host]^Glad you’re back. I sincerely loved killing you last time and I’m sure I will again. [category=host]^You know, my dad had this strict rule about not letting a killing spree overstay its welcome. So let\\'s make this a little bit more cut-throat. [category=host]^Ah crap. It\\'s check-out time and too many of you are still alive. Let\\'s fix that. [category=host]^This is taking forever. And I still need to hose this place down before my next guests arrive. Let\\'s speed this up. [category=host]^Well, this is fun... but I need it to end. Time to get serious. [category=host]^Oh, I forgot I have dinner reservations. We need to wrap this up. [category=host]^But let’s not forget that not drinking is also a punishable offense.[category=host]^It\\'s kind of arbitrary but you had the most money. Anywho... [category=host]^See, having the most money is good for SOMETHING. [category=host]^If they do better than you... you die. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You\\'ll die if they do better than you. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Pick a chalice to drop your poison in.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^It\\'s my old friend, the Loser Wheel. [category=host]^Oh look, it\\'s the Loser Wheel. [category=host]^Time to be subjected to the Loser Wheel. [category=host]^It\\'s Loser Wheel time! [category=host]^You were just getting some momentum going and then WHAM! You\\'re dead. [category=host]^Pretty mediocre performance if I\\'m being honest. Sorry, not sorry! [category=host]^For a second there I thought you were gonna make it to the final round... but uh... NOPE! [category=host]^Honestly? You... could have done better. [category=host]^Drink something![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Oooo... who\\'s gonna win this one!! [category=host]^Oh, this one is a nail biter! [category=host]^Pass me the popcorn, this one\\'s close!! [category=host]^Wow. I don\\'t know who\\'s gonna win! [category=host]^Oh my gosh! Who\\'s it gonna be?! [category=host]^I just love all this drama! [category=host]^Just do it already! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Come on, it\\'s not going to spin itself. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Time is almost up![category=host]^[Silence][category=host][Unsubtitled]^Oh great, we didn\\'t even get to the drinking poison part! [category=host]^Ooo, just one question away from reaching the final round. Bummer. [category=host]^You just HAD to go and die ONE question away from the final round. That\\'s annoying. [category=host]^I hope it makes you feel worse to know that you were just one question away from the final round. [category=host]^Ooo, so close yet so far. [category=host]^Wait! Some of you didn’t drink? I guess that means I have to kill you myself.[category=host]^Oops! Didn\\'t mean to kill ALL of you. But I still need one alive player sooo... [category=host]^Ah crap. I killed EVERYBODY? I guess I\\'ll bring one of you back. [category=host]^Woah. You all die too easy. But I still need SOMEONE alive sooo... [category=host]^Aww was that one too hard for you![category=host]^Tough one. [category=host]^So much failure. [category=host]^Gooooood question. [category=host]^A swing and several misses. [category=host]^Went down like bowling pins. [category=host]^Does it feel good to be so wrong? [category=host]^That.  Was.  Rough.  [category=host]^If you were trying to get it wrong, you nailed it.

[category=host]^You stole my Father’s lifeforce![category=host]^You got got, Dad![category=host]^No longer in the lead, are you, Father?![category=host]^Here comes the next question.[category=host][3]^Next question. [category=host]^Moving on. [category=host]^Only one of you is still alive.[category=host]^If any of them do better than you... you\\'ll die. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^If one of them does better than you... it\\'s punishment time. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^If you drink from a poisoned chalice... you die! I mean, obviously! Duh. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Poison does what poison does, so if you drink from a poisoned chalice, bye-eeeee. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Drinking from a cup with a poison pellet will kill you... If you trust doctors! Pshhh![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Fun fact: Poison is deadly. So if you drink from a poisoned cup... You die!  [category=host][Unsubtitled]^This poison, like all poison, will kill you. So choose carefully.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^This poison is the bad kind of poison, so choose carefully.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^If you drink from a poisoned cup… ya dead![category=host][Unsubtitled]^If you want to survive, I’d pick a cup with no poison. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Most people are poison intolerant, so try not to drink the poison. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Hot tip... a poisoned chalice will kill you. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^And maybe try to pick one that looks less poison-y. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Aww, looks like you couldn\\'t quite make it happen. [category=host]^Looks like you were out-mathed! [category=host]^Looks like you brought a knife to a math fight. Which is bad. [category=host]^I guess you\\'re not quite good enough at math. [category=host]^I guess needing to know math DID become relevant in your life after all, huh? [category=host]^As we say in team sports, you were mathematically eliminated. [category=host]^Wow, this ended with you to the power of dead. [category=host]^I guess you plus math equals dead. [category=host]^I knew it! Math IS dangerous. [category=host]^This is what they mean by aftermath. [category=host]^Let the darkness consume you![category=host][6]^You are but shadows now! [category=host]^Enjoy oblivion in the darkness! [category=host]^There\\'s always room in the darkness. [category=host]^Hellloooo! Darkness! [category=host]^You won’t be forgotten... Whoever you were. [category=host]^Lights out for you! [category=host]^Time to make friends with the darkness! [category=host]^Don’t let the darkness hit you on the way out. [category=host]^Too slow, so you gotta go!

The loser wheel is overdue for servicing. [category=host]^Ugh, I cannot even with this.  [category=host]^How incredibly surprising and disappointing.  [category=host]^Well, serves me right for reusing an old minigame. Big mistake. [category=host]^Starring^OneAlive^Which leaves only you![category=host]^ManyAlive^The rest of you...[category=host]^What\\'s fun about this is that the odds are clearly really bad. [category=host]^What\\'s more fun than watching spinning?!! [category=host]^Spin you magnificent wheel!! [category=host]^The wheel is my favorite simple machine. [category=host]^I gotta admit, this is NOBODY’S favorite game! [category=host]^Croupier, I’m putting all my money on Death! [category=host]^Just like The Price Is Right, but totally different, for legal reasons. [category=host]^I love taking this thing out for a spin. [category=host]^If you get dizzy and puke, that’s just icing on the death cake.  [category=host]^Aww no one drank any poison.[category=host]^What?! No one drank ANY poison?! [category=host]^No one? Well... that sucks.  [category=host]^So if you feel sick, it\\'s just your diet.  [category=host]^Cowards!  [category=host]^I used the good cups for nothing!  [category=host]^Your loss!

[category=host]^What do you think I am… made of poison pellets?[category=host]^I guess I have to do EVERYTHING around here. [category=host]^I hope you\\'re not saving pellets hoping to poison me with them later... because joke\\'s on you, there\\'s no interface in this game to do something like that! [category=host]^I should make a note to order more poison pellets online. [category=host]^If you don’t put the poison in yourself then you won’t feel complicit in the eventual death, which is kinda the whole point![category=host]^Too good to poison your friends!? Well, I’m sorry... your majesty![category=host]^You’re really missing out on the joy of poisoning your peers. [category=host]^By the way, I’m like totally obsessed with these cups. [category=host]^You know, these chalices don\\'t poison themselves. Well, I guess the ones with lead paint kind of do. [category=host]^Everyone else will be playing along.

[category=host]^I\\'m excited to see what everybody took! [category=host]^I keep it in a pile for tax reasons. [category=host]^I keep my money like this because it sparks joy. [category=host]^Some of this money is still here from the first game. [category=host]^It’s gross and slimy, but it still spends!! [category=host]^I don’t keep it under my mattress. It IS my mattress. [category=host]^Most of it\\'s spattered with dried blood, but they accept it at my hardware store. [category=host]^This is every dollar I earned that summer I was a lifeguard. [category=host]^That’s my babysitting money. [category=host]^It really pulls the room together. [category=host]^I guess I should buy a wallet at some point.

[category=host]^Who picked...[category=host]^This is not a joke…[category=host][Unsubtitled]^For real though... [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Maybe I wasn\\'t clear... [category=host][Unsubtitled]^That’s my father’s hat. I want you to wear it.[category=host]^Ah crap. It\\'s my dad\\'s old hat. [category=host]^Uh oh, you found my dad\\'s hat. [category=host]^Ah... my Grandpappy Jack\\'s glasses. [category=host]^Choose a finger to cut off or you die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Oh, it\\'s one of Uncle Clive\\'s old time bombs. [category=host]^You look beautiful, Mother! I remember when… w-what’s that Mother? You want to go to scoreboard now? But I… Yes, Mother…[category=host]^Oh hello Mother. I didn\\'t know you were playing the game. I hope you do well. [category=host]^Oh Mother! I\\'ve missed you! I\\'m a big boy now, Mother. I\\'m glad you\\'re playing my big boy game. [category=host]^Oh Mother! It’s you! I thought you were dead. That must be someone else’s skeleton in the attic.[category=host]^Mother! Mother you’re alive! I thought that coffin was screaming when we buried it![category=host]^Mother! I knew you’d be back! Now give me a kiss and get back to the game.  [category=host]^Oh Mother, my dear mother, I don\\'t think you have anything to worry about.  WIIIINNKK.   [category=host]^I’d let you go Mother! But I can’t ignore my duties as a murderous trivia host! It’s how you raised me![category=host]^Uhh I hate this place. It\\'s so creepy![category=host]^The supernatural is such a pain in the butt, right? [category=host]^Ugh. Ghosts, am I right?! [category=host]^But it\\'s a very pretty handmirror. [category=host]^But if you\\'re possessed by a real dum-dum it\\'s not a big deal. [category=host]^Hopefully it\\'s not a real smart and fast ghost, for your sake. [category=host]^You\\'ll see what I mean soon. [category=host]^You’ll have to answer questions a lot faster now to keep from blowing up.[category=host]^Oh look, it\\'s Grandma Despair\\'s knife. [category=host]^Ah, it\\'s my Grandma Despair\\'s knife. [category=host]^It\\'s the knife that belonged to my Grandma Despair. [category=host]^Pick a box and keep what\\'s inside. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^He succumbed to supernatural madness. [category=host]^Pick something!! Sheesh! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Stop stalling! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Hurry up and grab a weird gross box! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Stop window shopping and pick something! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^They say they let him see things no mortal mind can comprehend. [category=host]^Rumor has it they let him see into the beyond. [category=host]^Chop Chop…[category=host][Unsubtitled]^(exasperated) Come on!!! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Just cut it already! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Well... I guess it’s your knife now.[category=host]^I always just called her Gam Gam. [category=host]^Grandma Despair was just a nickname. Her real name was Edwina Despair. [category=host]^It\\'s really just a knife. Nothing supernatural or anything. [category=host]^Fun fact, she wasn\\'t really my grandmother, just a family friend that killed and replaced my grandmother. [category=host]^My whole family was always really into knives. [category=host]^Looks like you’re bringing a knife to a trivia fight.  [category=host]^Always good to get extra fingerprints on a knife.  [category=host]^She killed a lot of drifters with this...but she was from a different generation.  [category=host]^This was part of a set, but the rest are still in a body.  [category=host]^This will be perfect if you run into an unsliced pie.  [category=host]^She said we could take that knife from her cold, dead hands, so we did!   [category=host]^See, I can be giving. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^This room smells weird. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Ah, memories. They’re the worst.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Family stuff is weird, huh? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Don’t shake them or you’ll wake them. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Avoid the ones with air holes. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^The water damage is part of the charm. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Choose wisely...or randomly! It’s up to you. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Beware the one with the prettiest paper. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You just found my mother’s wig![category=host]^Oh, it\\'s my mother\\'s wig... umm... put it on... [category=host]^Oh dear. My mother\\'s wig. I\\'m powerless when I think Mother\\'s around. [category=host]^Oh. My mother\\'s wig. Is she...? Are you...? [category=host]^My mother\\'s wig. It\\'s a good thing I\\'m not one of those dummies that easily gets tricked by wigs. [category=host]^All this family stuff holds bad memories for me… so I’d rather pass that burden on to you! [category=host]^I read a Marie Kondo book and now I need to get rid of a bunch of crap. [category=host]^I can’t sell this stuff online because the FBI is looking for most of it. [category=host]^I need to thin out these terrifying family heirlooms a bit. [category=host]^Please accept these gifts before the cops bag them as evidence. [category=host]^These are precious family treasures I give away as punishments.[category=host]^Help yourself to a totem that represents my family drama. [category=host]^It’s a complimentary family nightmare in a box. [category=host]^Some families hide their shame. We gift wrap them. [category=host]^One person’s family heirloom is another person’s punishment. [category=host]^I’ve tried to white elephant this stuff, but it always finds its way back to me. [category=host]^Okay I’m gonna be honest... this is bringing up a lot of emotions for me… Like, I kind of HATE you right now, Daddy. But I am a professional, and I promise to not let this affect me going forward.[category=host]^You never thought I\\'d make anything of myself, did you?! Well guess what Dad, you\\'re playing my game now! [category=host]^Huh, this is weird. On one level I know that you\\'re not really my dad. But at the same time I am filled with rage and this is not going to go well for you overall. [category=host]^Just know this DAD... there\\'s no way I\\'m going to let you survive this game. That\\'s not a threat, that\\'s a promise. [category=host]^Hey, everybody, look... it\\'s my DAD! Don\\'t worry, he won\\'t be alive a whole lot longer. [category=host]^My therapist is always trying to get me to roleplay through my \\\"daddy issues,\\\" so this is a good opportunity for me to really take it all out on you. I think this will be good for me.[category=host]^Oh, so you’ve finally returned from the \\\"grocery store,\\\" huh, FATHER!? I don’t care who wins, as long as it’s not you. [category=host]^Way to show up, DAD.  Always making it about you, huh?  Great, fine, let’s play.  [category=host]^Years of therapy should have prepared me for this, DAD.  But I never went.  So, this’ll go just great.  [category=host]^It’s you dad! And don’t bother screaming “I’m not your real father,” I heard enough of that growing up.[category=host]^Dad! You’re back! Now I can finally get closure... deadly closure![category=host]^Well Father... you’re back and this time I’m the one in charge. So I’m gonna eat candy for dinner and you’re going to die![category=host]^Wow, it\\'s my Aunty Vale\\'s handmirror. [category=host]^Oh cool, it\\'s the cursed mirror that belonged to my old Aunty Vale. [category=host]^Why don’t you umm… choose one of your fingers to cut off?[category=host]^Anyway, I\\'m going to need you to choose a finger to cut off. [category=host]^Anyway, now you have to use that knife to cut one of your fingers off. [category=host]^But I\\'m sure YOU\\'LL be fine. Moving on!! [category=host]^But then again he was a drunk. So, you know, could have been that.[category=host]^So... watch out for that, I guess. Moving on!! [category=host]^Or maybe he could have just used a therapist. Who knows? It was a different time. Let\\'s get out of here. [category=host]^I hope you don\\'t see anything weird. Let\\'s get out of here. [category=host]^So... that\\'s not exactly good news for YOU, huh? Let\\'s keep moving. [category=host]^So let us know if you start seeing weird stuff. Moving on!! [category=host]^Fair warning, you\\'re possessed by a ghost now. If they answer faster than you they\\'ll block out that answer choice for you. [category=host]^Oh, FYI, you\\'re vulnerable to possession now by a ghost. So try to answer before them or whatever answer they pick will be blocked out on your device. [category=host]^I hope you like gifts. [category=host]^Oh, you\\'re going to get a gift. [category=host]^Okay, this one is more of an \\\"experience.\\\" [category=host]^This one\\'s just about me giving you a gift. [category=host]^On your device, choose a row or a column to run your sword through.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Ta dah![category=host]^Ooo! Ahhh! [category=host]^Ouchie. [category=host]^(self-satisfied laugh) [category=host]^That’s… gotta hurt. [category=host]^Nice! [category=host]^Yes!!! [category=host]^Oh, I needed that.  [category=host]^I wonder if that’ll grow back. [category=host]^Aww... you didn’t make a password… That’s okay. I can make one for you.[category=host]^Couldn\\'t think of a four letter word? Yikes! Okay, I\\'ll type one in for you. [category=host]^Couldn\\'t think of one? I\\'ll enter one for you. [category=host]^Ugh… I’m sooooo glad you worked that out. Lame…[category=host]^(disappointed) Oh great, you all learned an important lesson about working together. Hooray...[category=host]^Did I not make it clear that at least one of you should try to betray the others? Come on![category=host]^I didn’t expect this to turn into a team building exercise. I was hoping some people would die. [category=host]^That was very selfish of you all. I wanted some dying.[category=host]^BOOORING! [category=host]^Everyone else is playing too. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Follow as many rules as you can before time runs out. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Time\\'s almost up![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Some of you did not take this job seriously![category=host]^I don\\'t know who to be the most mad at here. [category=host]^Wow, so much unacceptable content here. [category=host]^Oh, this is not good. [category=host]^Go ahead and talk to each other. I’m sure no one will lie and get you all killed.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Feel free to chat and lie about what you\\'re going to do. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Talk amongst yourselves. You all seem totally trustworthy. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^It’s human nature to find consensus… or maybe the opposite? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I have a good feeling about this. Whatever that means. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Everyone is going into this with the best intentions, right? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^This is a good trust building exercise, and it might be your last. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Feel free to discuss a game plan. Not that anyone will stick to it. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Rule time is coming to an end![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Almost out of Rules time! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Write down as much of what I say as you can.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Tattoos.  [category=host]^It\\'s tattoo time. [category=host]^This is my tattoo parlor. [category=host]^Ah yes, tattoos. [category=host]^Vote already![category=host][Unsubtitled]^The player who wrote the answer with the fewest votes dies![category=host]^The player that gets the fewest votes... DIES! [category=host]^What did we decide?[category=host]^Okay! You hide... and my sword will seek.[category=host]^Now I\\'ll close my eyes and just randomly whack this sword in there. [category=host]^And I\\'ll just thrust this sword into a random spot! [category=host]^Without looking, I\\'ll just stab into this thing. [category=host]^I’m going to dictate a message to you.[category=host]^Everyone pick an elevator door. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Choose now or I\\'ll choose for you![category=host]^Now we learn obedience.[category=host]^I hope you\\'re good with instructions. [category=host]^This one should be easy. [category=host]^Go![category=host][Unsubtitled]^The rules are already on your device! Go! Go! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^It\\'s already begun! The rules are on your device now! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Great! And now there\\'s a tie, so you\\'re all safe?! This is just not my day...[category=host]^Pick a space in this box to hide yourself.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Pick a space inside the box to hide. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Now I\\'m gonna need some volunteers.[category=host]^Any good magic trick needs some helpful volunteers. [category=host]^It\\'s time for the volunteers. [category=host]^Of course, this magic trick does need some volunteers. [category=host]^Looks like some people didn\\'t think it was necessary to hide.[category=host]^I hate it when people are too lazy to pick their own place to hide. [category=host]^En guarde![category=host]^Stab! Stab! [category=host]^Magic! [category=host]^Sword noise! [category=host]^Parry, thrust! [category=host]^Mind Freak! [category=host]^Say “Entrails!” [category=host]^Slice, slice! [category=host]^Many^As a team, guess the password on your device.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^One^Guess the password on your device.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^QUIPLASH![category=host]^Hurry up! I’ll kill you now if you don’t make a decision![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Come on! Pick a door or I\\'ll kill you! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Stop holding up the elevators!! Pick! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Enter a real four-letter word with your device. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^The game will send a funny writing prompt to your devices. [category=host]^The game will send a question to your devices. [category=host]^I will reward you ALL for every password that gets got. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I will reward you ALL for every password you figure out in time. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I will reward you ALL for every password you crack. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I will reward you ALL for every password you guess in time. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Enter the best answer you can think of and hit send.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Type in the funniest answer you can think of and hit send. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Oh yeah, and since there\\'s an even number of you, I\\'m going to add some weight to one side.[category=host]^And don\\'t think a tie will keep anybody safe because I have a fix for that. [category=host]^Love my new ink, brah![category=host]^That\\'s some sweet ink. [category=host]^Oh my goodness, I have become a work of art. [category=host]^The process is complete!! [category=host]^Ah, we’re in that moment where the tattooing is done but the regret hasn’t set in yet. [category=host]^I’m so excited about my cool new look! [category=host]^Yay! It’s a whole new me! [category=host]^I kinda feel dangerous now. I mean, more dangerous. [category=host]^That was really transformative for me. [category=host]^I guess I had something else in mind, but I\\'m sure it’ll grow on me. [category=host]^Okay, somebody went to art school. I think we know who.  [category=host]^Honestly, I\\'ve never looked better. [category=host]^Couldn\\'t think of anything, huh? I got you covered.[category=host]^As a team, guess either password on your device.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Guess either password on your device. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You get a clue if your guess has a letter in the right spot.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^It’s a tie! I guess you get to live… Ha-ha! Yeah right! You’re like totally dead![category=host]^In case you were wondering... yes, I do have a rule about how I deal with ties. [category=host]^Some people think ties are anticlimactic, but I think it\\'s a good opportunity to punish more people! [category=host]^Okay, let’s see what the people think. [category=host]^Let\\'s see the votes. [category=host]^If anyone figures out the password before time runs out, I will reward you ALL![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Don’t worry. It’s not like your life depends on it.[category=host]^When this was used in magic shows, there were safeguards inside to prevent injury. But don\\'t worry, I took those out. [category=host]^Some spots are better than others, but don’t overthink it. [category=host]^I wish I had a magician’s assistant for this, but oh well. [category=host]^I’m not sure if there’s oxygen so try shallow breathing. [category=host]^I would say don’t get too comfortable but I feel like that’s obvious. [category=host]^Oh, I sure do hope you\\'re claustrophobic! [category=host]^Aww man...[category=host]^Are you frickin\\' kidding me?! [category=host]^Ugh, this would never happen to Criss Angel! [category=host]^Aw, I hate misdirection. [category=host]^What a terrible trick. [category=host]^How is that entertaining? Jeez. [category=host]^BOOOOO!!! [category=host]^Magic, you disappointed me again. [category=host]^This trick usually kills at parties. [category=host]^Ugh, what\\'s the point? [category=host]^Make it hard to guess. If your password gets cracked, you die![category=host]^Don\\'t make it easy. If someone cracks your password, you die![category=host]^My body is a roadmap of suffering.[category=host]^I just love the art of body mutilation! [category=host]^I know a serial killer with crazy tattoos is like totally cliche, but pfff, whatever. [category=host]^It\\'s the only way I can feel anything. [category=host]^It’s time for me to get some ink like a real bad boy. [category=host]^My body is the canvas of your nightmares. Or for unicorns! [category=host]^It’s art that hurts! [category=host]^I’ll never regret this! [category=host]^I promise I won’t pass out this time. [category=host]^You got outperformed.[category=host]^You were... NOT the best! [category=host]^Well... you failed! [category=host]^I\\'m going to give you a chance to password protect your life. [category=host]^This one lets you protect yourself with a password. [category=host]^Time to try to save yourself with a password. [category=host]^This is a team effort so share clues out loud with each other![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Don\\'t be greedy about what letters you\\'ve figured out. Let everyone know! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^This assignment was not optional.[category=host]^Volunteers get one sword.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Now, can you confirm that we\\'ve never met before? Just kidding. A little magician banter. You get a sword. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I\\'m giving you a very sharp sword. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Good news, I\\'m giving you a sword. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Here\\'s the fun part: you get a sword! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Okay, take this cool sword. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^A tie. Well, fine… if you really want me to weigh in…[category=host]^A tie? Luckily I only like one of these. [category=host]^I break all ties, especially when I think one of the answers is hot garbage. [category=host]^I\\'m not sure I get either of these, but if I have to break the tie... [category=host]^Well, that was anticlimactic. Oh well…[category=host]^Thanks for screwing up my game! [category=host]^My least favorite outcome. [category=host]^One of you did not take this job seriously![category=host]^Yikes, one of you did REAL bad! [category=host]^Well, one of you was the worst. [category=host]^I am especially disappointed with one of you. [category=host]^Hey, have you ever played this game Quiplash?![category=host]^Why don\\'t we just relax and play the game Quiplash? [category=host]^Screw it, let\\'s play a game of Quiplash. [category=host]^Just like Ariana Grande, I\\'m addicted to Quiplash! [category=host]^Ya know what? I just want to play Quiplash! [category=host]^We\\'re gonna play Quiplash! [category=host]^Ooo. You got hacked, son! [category=host]^I hope you do a better job with your bank account password. [category=host]^Your security\\'s been breached. [category=host]^That password did NOT hold. [category=host]^Pretty weak password. [category=host]^You thought that would be too hard to guess? [category=host]^What’s the opposite of a firewall? Cause that’s you. [category=host]^Woof! Well, I hope the rest of your passwords are harder than that. [category=host]^Let’s see where you all landed.[category=host]^The player who writes the fewest of my words will die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Enter something or I will be VERY angry [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Enter something hilarious NOW! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^The artist with the fewest votes will die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^What the heck...[category=host]^Well, now I\\'m mad at everybody. [category=host]^Now, vote for your favorite design.[category=host]^Now, vote for your favorite tat. [category=host]^Oh come on! If you don\\'t pick a row or column I\\'ll do it for you.[category=host]^Gee! I wonder where they\\'re hiding![category=host]^Well, I guess you\\'re hired! If you\\'re still alive tomorrow, work starts at 8 am sharp and bring your own lunch [category=host]^Well... I don\\'t like you... but I respect your work!! [category=host]^You get to live for now, but I\\'m keeping my eye on you. [category=host]^Okay, you get to live. And now I have to figure out if stamps are still a thing. [category=host]^PS... good job! [category=host]^Taking dictation is a lost art and you... eh, you were fine. [category=host]^But if there’s a split decision, I will kill everyone on the HEAVIER side![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Sorry, but “rules” are “rules.\\\" [category=host]^Aww... You tried so hard to follow the rules, which was like SUPER CUTE... but it just wasn\\'t enough. [category=host]^There\\'s always someone out there better at following rules. [category=host]^I guess you were over-RULED. [category=host]^Rules out for summer. You lose. [category=host]^You got out-ruled! [category=host]^Look, I don’t make the rules... wait, no, I do. I do make the rules.[category=host]^Create a new tattoo on my back by drawing on your device.[category=host]^Give me a new tattoo by drawing on your device. [category=host]^Boring...[category=host]^Boooo! [category=host]^Uh oh![category=host]^1^How about one that rhymes with HEAD.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^It\\'s going to be a word that rhymes with BILL.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^But your password is going to start with an H and end with a T. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^How about one that rhymes with FART? It actually is FART, by the way. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Hmm. I can\\'t think of a password. DUCK? Okay, well, it\\'s NOT duck. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^And I\\'m putting your password in the closed captioning (it\\'s DUMP) so if you have it turned on everyone will see it. [category=host]^It’s time for my favorite illusion![category=host]^Let\\'s use one of my Cousin Aloysius\\'s old stage props. [category=host]^It’s magic time! [category=host]^Yay! I love using Cousin Aloysius’s magic props. [category=host]^Ah, the old skewers trick. [category=host]^I hope you like magic tricks. [category=host]^I\\'m excited I finally have enough people over to play it. [category=host]^Hey, it\\'s exhausting coming up with these minigame ideas!! [category=host]^(sigh) I wish the rest of that Party Pack was as good. [category=host]^What can I say?! I love makin\\' jokes with my buds!! [category=host]^It’s a game within a game... BONG!! INCEPTION!!  [category=host]^I mean, who doesn’t love Quiplash? I don’t wanna meet that person![category=host]^I like fun things too. You know, fun things other than murder. [category=host]^I always mean to host a game night, but you know how a week gets away from ya.  [category=host]^I’ve made a version with some Killer Generated Prompts. [category=host]^Even my mom likes it and she’s been dead for years. [category=host]^It’s no Drawful, but what is?! [category=host]^Oh, the laughs we’re going to have. [category=host]^If you all pick the same side, you all live.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Voting time is almost over…[category=host]^Last chance to get your votes in.... [category=host]^Ugh... well that’s no fun...[category=host]^I hate that you survived but I respect your attention to detail! [category=host]^Oh great. you followed the rules correctly. A regular teacher\\'s pet over here. [category=host]^Moments like this is why this is my least favorite minigame.[category=host]^I knew I should have made those rules more confusing.[category=host]^If you weren’t so good at rules, nerd, this could’ve gone better for me.[category=host]^Wow. Good for you. Is my sarcasm coming in clear?[category=host]^You did well. And I’m not mad about it, just disappointed.[category=host]^It shouldn\\'t take this long to think up a four letter word. [category=host]^Hurry up! [category=host]^Come on! [category=host]^Time’s almost up![category=host]^Aw man, it\\'s no fun when no one breaches the cybersecurity. [category=host]^It was just four letters! That shouldn’t be unguessable!! [category=host]^I would have gotten that one. Of course, I cheat. [category=host]^I am disappointed in everyone involved in this situation. [category=host]^I thought everyone was good at hacking passwords these days but I guess I was wrong! [category=host]^(clears throat) Ahem ahem. Okay, starting letter now. [category=host]^Get your typing fingers ready because I\\'m starting... right.... now. [category=host]^Okay, let me lean back in this chair and get my feet up. And we begin. [category=host]^And the letter begins... now. [category=host]^You\\'re lucky this is such a good letter and I\\'m starting it... now. [category=host]^Let\\'s give you both the same DUMB password.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^I\\'m making your passwords TUNA. Don\\'t tell anyone. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Your passwords are now BOTH. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Both of your passwords are one of the words I\\'m saying now. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^The player who follows the fewest rules correctly dies.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^This decision will weigh on you![category=host]^Let\\'s see if you put the \\\"dumb\\\" in dumbwaiters. [category=host]^Let\\'s play with my little toy elevators. [category=host]^Okay, we GOTTA use these weird little dumbwaiters. [category=host]^Ugh, this one is heavy! [category=host]^Ooo! This is a fun one! [category=host]^Alright, everyone else, vote for the answer you like the best.[category=host]^Really? Fine... I guess it\\'s up to me...[category=host]^Looks like I\\'ll have to do some of the swordplay myself. [category=host]^Alright, without further ado...[category=host]^Let\\'s see those quips. [category=host]^Okay, let\\'s see what gags and goofs you guys came up with! [category=host]^Let’s see the funny ha-has. [category=host]^Let’s get ‘lashed! [category=host]^Let’s see if you’re funnier than my neighbor! [category=host]^Let\\'s see \\'em! [category=host]^Ewww, gross! What did you do to my back![category=host]^Ewww, this ink has got to go. [category=host]^Yep! I\\'ll have to laser this off. [category=host]^I will not let this tattoo define me. [category=host]^Well, at least tattoos aren’t permanent. What?! They are?!! [category=host]^You should really consider using a stencil next time. [category=host]^This might actually look worse AFTER it heals. [category=host]^Great. Now I need a cover-up tattoo. [category=host]^Now I can never go shirtless at the beach again. Thanks a lot! [category=host]^Now, let\\'s see where the rest of you landed.[category=host]^Follow at least 7 rules correctly before time runs out or you die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Follow at least 10 rules correctly before time runs out or you die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Follow at least 15 rules correctly before time runs out or you die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Follow at least 20 rules correctly before time runs out or you die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Follow at least 25 rules correctly before time runs out or you die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^The people have spoken.[category=host]^The quips have been lashed. [category=host]^Okay... we have a loser. [category=host]^We have a clear mandate. [category=host]^Can\\'t argue with the votes. [category=host]^Losing happened! [category=host]^Here’s a direction for you… Die![category=host]^(very pleased with self) I\\'ve got one more rule for you. Die! [category=host]^As my Trapper Keeper in middle school said, \\\"I rules... you drools.\\\" I had a problem with spelling. [category=host]^You were a little too un-RULE-y! (awkward laugh)[category=host]^I was pretty clear about what would happen if you didn’t follow the rules. [category=host]^If you ask me, you have no one to blame but yourself. [category=host]^BYE-EEE! [category=host]^Oh man, I’d love to see you read an instruction manual. [category=host]^Did you think you were too cool for rules?! [category=host]^Well, it rules that I get to kill you now. [category=host]^Really? There are no safety quips when I play! [category=host]^Trying to ruin my fun party vibe, huh? [category=host]^Is this some of that anti-comedy BS? [category=host]^Serious Quiplash party foul! [category=host]^Nothing?! You\\'ve got nothing? Boo! [category=host]^You didn\\'t play, so you\\'re not invited to my next party. [category=host]^Now everyone else will try to crack the password. [category=host]^Now everyone else will try to crack the passwords.[category=host]^And here\\'s how you did. [category=host]^And what\\'s the result? [category=host]^I need your help sending an angry letter. [category=host]^I hope you\\'re good at taking dictation. [category=host]^Get ready, because I have a letter brewing in my head. [category=host]^Ah, the lost art of letter writing. [category=host]^This game is kind of complicated but I think you get the POINT.[category=host]^Fun fact, when I found this magic prop in the basement it was full of rabbit and dove skeletons. [category=host]^I\\'ve always hated magic. But I do love swords. [category=host]^I wonder if this is how Criss Angel feels every day of his life? [category=host]^\\\"Sword\\\" is a weird sounding word, right? Swords. Swords. Swwworrrds. [category=host]^Ugh, I feel underdressed. I should have worn a tuxedo or something.[category=host]^You know the song “Bleed It Out” by Linkin Park? It’s kind of a deep cut. [category=host]^I guess it’s less magic and more stabbing. [category=host]^I like to call this trick “Abraca-STAB-bra.\\\"   [category=host]^If you have trouble picking a spot, just take a stab at it.  [category=host]^I guess I\\'ll just put you here then.[category=host]^Luckily I\\'ve got a great spot picked out for you. [category=host]^No votes? How about no mercy![category=host]^If you don\\'t vote, you don\\'t get to complain. [category=host]^I hate it when people don\\'t vote. [category=host]^Aww, I was hoping for a donation... How about I make a donation instead? Your bodies - to science. Because I\\'m going to kill you... In case that wasn\\'t clear... [category=host]^No one gave any money to anybody? That just makes me mad. [category=host]^Come on! This isn\\'t my BEST minigame but you\\'re still required to participate!! [category=host]^Sometimes donating nothing is the smart move, but this isn\\'t one of those times. [category=host]^No donations! Didn\\'t anyone want the tax break! [category=host]^Nobody gave! I guess you\\'re too greedy for murder games. [category=host]^Look at all the penny pinchers. Ugh. Frustrating. [category=host]^Donations, more like No-nations. [category=host]^Oh for charity’s sake, what’s wrong with you people? [category=host]^Show me the money![category=host]^Now let\\'s follow the money. [category=host]^Let\\'s see where all the money went. [category=host]^Let\\'s see who gave what to who. [category=host]^Time to check the receipts.  [category=host]^Time for a credit check.  [category=host]^Time for fiscal revelations.  [category=host]^Let\\'s track that cash.  [category=host]^But if you give to someone and they have $1,000 or more, I will kill you instead! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Three^But if you give to someone and they have $800 or more, I will kill you instead! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Two^But there\\'s a catch: if one of you ends up with $800 or MORE... I\\'ll kill the other one instead! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Get rich AND die trying![category=host]^They say you can never be too rich, but you sure proved that wrong. [category=host]^It looks like money is the root of all your... something something... Look... I\\'m still working on a good line for this one. [category=host]^So much money. So much pain! [category=host]^Too rich for your blood! [category=host]^Mo\\' money, mo\\' murder. [category=host]^For the first time, the rich will suffer consequences. [category=host]^You can afford a very nice coffin. [category=host]^You are richest and you are deadest. [category=host]^Struck down by the almighty dollar. [category=host]^On their deathbed, no one says \\\"at least I made a bunch of money.\\\" Except you I guess. [category=host]^I’m feeling charitable.[category=host]^Donation time. [category=host]^Ah, the spirit of giving. [category=host]^It\\'s time for... Donations! [category=host]^Give some of that money to another player. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Give some of that money to your friend. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Hurry up![category=host][Unsubtitled]^The person who ends up with the most money will die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^The person with the MOST cash at the end will die.

Not so fast Father. No mercy for you. [category=host]^Oh, wait, duh... I can still punish my father. [category=host]^But I will betray you at every turn, Father!

[category=host]^I’m impressed that bomb hasn’t gone off yet. My uncle’s inventions were a lot like him: Not very stable.[category=host]^I never really liked my uncle but I have to admit that having one of his bombs in the game is really exciting![category=host]^I really hope that bomb goes off eventually. What can I say? I’m a completionist.[category=host]^You know, I also have a bomb strapped to MY body. It\\'s set to go off if I mispronounce any words. (beat) I think it\\'s broken. ^Don\\'t take this personally but I really hope that bomb kills you. Or I kill you. One way or another I hope you die. But again, it\\'s not personal.

[category=host]^Let\\'s play with spooky dice. [category=host]^I\\'ve been tinkering with this game design for, like, a really long time so I hope you like it![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Honestly, it\\'s mostly just an excuse to use these cool skull dice. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^It\\'s like blackjack but with dice... and skulls. Look, it made sense when I first put it together, okay? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^It\\'s kind of spooky to see skulls on dice. Ooo![category=host][Unsubtitled]^This is a game for people who like blackjack but hate using cards. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Ooo. Busted![category=host]^Ya busted! [category=host]^Low scores displease me.[category=host]^Uh oh... looks like you didn\\'t roll enough. [category=host]^I see you\\'re unlucky in dice. [category=host]^It\\'s your last chance to sneak a few extra rolls in...[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Time\\'s almost up... [category=host][Unsubtitled]^If anyone rolls a skull, that adds 1 to EVERYONE\\'S score.^You really... blew... it. Hahaha! Get it? [category=host]^One of the most common dangers of dice is blowing up. [category=host]^Explosions really are the best outcome for this game. [category=host]^Skulls. Dice. Explosions. Now that\\'s entertainment! [category=host]^Thank you for getting blown up. It makes me so happy. [category=host]^Well that sure made a mess, but it was worth it. [category=host]^But so will everyone else![category=host][Unsubtitled]^But so will all the safe players. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Happy scratching![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Scratch away! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Get to scratching! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Start scratching! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Now, Aunt Mildred is going to write a different word. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Congrats! All of you are entered in my scratch ticket giveaway![category=host]^I\\'m giving you all scratch tickets. What a quirky last minute gift! [category=host]^Congratulations! You\\'ve been entered in my scratch ticket giveaway! [category=host]^I\\'m giving you the laziest gift of all, a scratch ticket. [category=host]^Enter the right word now or you die.[category=host]^Scratch and find three dollar signs to live.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^If you have a losing ticket, come with me.[category=host]^We know what a losing ticket means. [category=host]^The contest is almost over.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^How hard is it to scratch 3 spots? Come on! [category=host]^I was very clear on how to play, and not scratching three spots will be punished! [category=host]^Scratching less than three spots is unacceptable. [category=host]^Keep going to win the big bucks![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Oooo... wouldn\\'t it feel good to scratch some more spots? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Why stop now? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^It might be fun to press your luck. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Come on! You could scratch more! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You could win some money with extra scratches. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^But if you scratch off even one skull, you die![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Draw a word on the mirror to camouflage Aunt Mildred\\'s.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Draw a word on the mirror and maybe you\\'ll trick someone into thinking it\\'s Aunt Mildred. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Let the drawing begin![category=host]^Go ahead and start writing! [category=host]^Start writing on that mirror. [category=host]^Aww, you got it?![category=host]^Whatever. That ghost has terrible penmanship. [category=host]^This is my second most disappointing experience with a mirror. [category=host]^Aw man. Mirrors are such bad luck for me. [category=host]^(muttering) Stupid mirror game. Unbelievable... [category=host]^I\\'m not sure who I\\'m most disappointed in, but I think it\\'s my dead aunt. [category=host]^Let me show you what’s behind the looking glass.[category=host]^It\\'s time for you to join my Aunt Mildred. [category=host]^EHH (buzz wrong sound)!! Aunt Mildred would, like, never say that! [category=host]^Ooo... umm... That\\'s a weird mistake. [category=host]^If you keep scratching, I’ll give you cash for every dollar sign you find.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^And if you keep scratching, I\\'ll give you cash for all the extra dollar signs you find. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Ugh, you did the bare minimum? Just like my father’s parenting style…[category=host]^Played it pretty safe. Boo! [category=host]^(disappointed) It’s no fun for me if you don’t scratch more spots. [category=host]^Didn’t want to risk it?  How boring. [category=host]^I guess I was hoping you’d be a little bit more scratch happy. Oh well. [category=host]^Ugh, lame. [category=host]^Scratch and find three dollar signs to live^But if you scratch off even one skull, you die!^Keep scratching and win cash!^I hope you can hold your breath![category=host]^I hope you don\\'t mind a little water! [category=host]^Tough break! Choose another key.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^So far, so bad. Choose another key. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You’re supposed to find the key that WORKS. Try again. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Not off to a great start. Choose another key. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I love how this combines the tension of impending death with the tedium of not being able to find the right key. Try again. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Couple choices here: drowning or choose another key. Up to you! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I always mix up my keys at home too.  So annoying.  Try again. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^I don’t want to tell you what to do here, but pick a different key. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^On a scale of one to that key doesn’t work, pick a new key. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Frustrating, right? Choose another key. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Oh no! One more chance to save yourself![category=host][Unsubtitled]^You\\'re really bad at finding the right key. One last chance! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^One last chance to avoid drowning. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Hurry up, MacGyver! You’re running out of time. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Find the right key or die.  Was that not clear before? [category=host][Unsubtitled]^This is it. Your last chance. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Only one of these keys will open the lock to your tank.[category=host]^0^Choose a key or I’ll just pick one of the wrong keys for you.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Don’t let the pressure get to you... the water pressure that is! High five! [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Don’t just float there... Do something![category=host][Unsubtitled]^Pick the right key before you drown.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^So many keys to choose from. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You’ve been very resilient, but only one of you can survive this game.[category=host]^Okay, this is a game where only one person can survive. So...[category=host]^Water way to go…[category=host]^This would be a good time for an awesome key pun. Hmm... eh, maybe next time. [category=host]^Finding keys is hard. I think we can all relate. [category=host]^There are worse ways to go… unless you have a fear of drowning. Then it\\'s real bad. [category=host]^Uh, I just remembered I have oxygen tanks in storage… SORRY! [category=host]^I guess I could’ve given you less keys. Welp. Hindsight is 20/20. [category=host]^It\\'s no Loser Wheel but it gets the job done. [category=host]^Cop: Wow! I am surprised that worked.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: Wow! I\\'m surprised that worked.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: Wow! Between you and me, I was convinced you were going to mess that up! Thank you for proving me wrong.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: Wow! You did it! You diffused that bomb. Good work![category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Wow! That’s a lot of dice! Good luck with that![category=host]^Ha ha. Yep, you\\'re in trouble. [category=host]^Look at that dice collection. [category=host]^Would you care for some dice with your dice? [category=host]^You know... there are people in the world that have no dice at all. You should feel fortunate. [category=host]^Oh yea, your odds are astronomically bad now. [category=host]^I guess it doesn’t help to tell you less is more. [category=host]^Ha ha ha! Dice pile-up! Classic![category=host]^Another dice game!? Ah-huh! I know! I\\'m like obsessed with dice. [category=host]^Oh hey, more dice! [category=host]^More dice? Don\\'t mind if I do! [category=host]^Now roll![category=host]^Time to roll. [category=host]^Roll \\'em! [category=host]^Roll the dice! [category=host]^Oops. Sorry. My bad. Congrats on winning the game Mom! I’ll umm... I\\'ll let myself out.[category=host]^I guess I was just being paranoid but you definitely passed the mom test. So you get to live. Bye for now Mom.[category=host]^Good work! I never really doubted you for a second Mother! (nervously) Bye bye! Rest up![category=host]^You’re not my mother! Ooo, that makes me so mad. It’s time to pay.[category=host]^(clapping) Well, good work on fooling me this long. I really thought you were my mother. But since you’re obviously not I guess I have to kill you now. You know how it is.[category=host]^Oh great. I got catfished by a fake mom. How embarrassing. Well, I better cover this up by killing you.[category=host]^My money’s on the player with 6 dice! Am I right?[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Cop: I’m actually one day away from retirement so I hope this goes well.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: I\\'m actually one day away from retirement so fingers crossed.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^You\\'d rather die than roll dice. ...Cool.[category=host]^Roll the dice or something bad will happen![category=host][Unsubtitled]^You won\\'t like what happens if you don\\'t roll.

What did we decide?[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^MADNESS^Weird Doctor: It all comes down to this...[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^You have an extra die that you can give to whoever you want to make their odds worse. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Cop: Let’s see if Yahoo Answers has anything about diffusing old time bombs.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: Okay, let me just google “deactivating time bomb” and see what we get.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: I have this old world almanac I carry around with me. Maybe it has some advice on bombs.[category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: Let\\'s just see if there\\'s anything on diffusing bombs in this dusty old officer\\'s guidebook. [category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^So to truly win, you have to answer this.[category=host]^You know I was hoping you\\'d team up on someone but I guess we can do it this boring way instead. Yeah, you know what? It-it\\'s... It\\'s... It\\'s fine...[category=host]^Hmm,  that doesn\\'t change a whole lot… oh well...[category=host]^Oh, good job making it way too fair. Oh brother... [category=host]^A little too evenhanded if you ask me, but whatever… [category=host]^Okay, fine, do it the boring way! [category=host]^I see you went the least exciting route. Yay... [category=host]^What’s with the even distribution? I don\\'t endorse this. [category=host]^Ugh! You’re killing me with your boring choices! [category=host]^The point is to gang up on another player. Have you learned nothing from me?! [category=host]^You think you’re so great beating my game that I worked so hard on, but I can make up whatever rules I want.[category=host]^Congrats on winning my game. I bet that makes you feel real big. But it’s still my game, Dad.[category=host]^But we\\'ve got some help to make this more interesting.  [category=host][Unsubtitled]^Cop: Hey, knock knock. I\\'m Officer Trevor. [category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Cop: Sorry to interrupt, I\\'m Officer Trevor. [category=host][EventName=HOST/AltHost]^Oh, hello Father.[category=host]^(with utter contempt) Hello Dad.[category=host]^Whoa! Luck was not on your side…  Ya know who\\'s also not on your side? Me![category=host]^Wait... what? That\\'s a surprise, but oh well. [category=host]^Wow. Beating the odds, but that means someone else is beaten by the odds. [category=host]^What weird luck. [category=host]^Lady luck has her own agenda sometimes. [category=host]^Sometimes odds are just so… odd![category=host]^That’s weird, but as long as someone dies I don’t really care. [category=host]^Isn’t life just full of surprises? [category=host]^Did you seriously not give them your dice?! Ugh! Whatever…[category=host]^No dice? Get it? As in, you didn\\'t bother to give away your... Ya know what? Nevermind. [category=host]^Gonna be lazy with your dice, huh? Pff! Whatever. [category=host]^It\\'s no fun to keep your dice, but to each their own. [category=host]^I honestly kind of wished you’d gotten that one right, Dad. But you didn’t so it all ends here.[category=host]^Oh, come on! Are you frickin\\' kidding me!? Would it have killed you to at least try to pay attention to my interests for like, two seconds? I mean, Sheesh! Anyway, speaking of killing you…[category=host]^But I’m starting to suspect that maybe you’re not my real mother. And that would be bad. [category=host]^The player who rolls the highest will die.[category=host][Unsubtitled]^Don\\'t worry. This one’s real straightforward.[category=host]^It\\'s real simple. [category=host]^You… you remember. You really do care. Oh Dad! I’ve never been so happy for someone to escape my game![category=host]^(sobbing) I love you, Dad. I forgive you. Thank you. You’re the best.[category=host]^Oh, Dad. I’m so happy! You see me! You really see me! (sobbing) We’re gonna be best friends!![category=host]^“But I had more dice than everyone else!” Yeah, kinda the point! You’re dead. [category=host]^Oh... wow... what a big surprise! [category=host]^We knew how this would turn out, but it was still fun to watch. [category=host]^That can’t feel great! [category=host]^You really put the die in dice! [category=host]^Look on the bright side: you can be buried with all that dice! [category=host]^You’re so good at rolling, you can roll into your own grave. [category=host]^The actual dying will probably be less painful than being singled out for the extra dice. [category=host]^Inevitable. But still fun! [category=host]^Let\\'s play a dice game![category=host]^Time to get out the dice. [category=host]^So I have one more question for you.

[category=host][Unsubtitled]^I made this timer longer so you can write something funny and then maybe do some light stretching. [category=host][Unsubtitled]^You should have plenty of time to write something funny, or to Google something funny and plagiarize it.

[category=host][Unsubtitled]^MUSIC/WelcomeMusic^Growing up I always told myself I wouldn’t get into the family business of killing people in this hotel… but you probably never expected to be killed in this hotel either. Ha, life\\'s just funny, you know?[category=host]^I was raised in a family of hotel-owning serial killers. I never really fit in. I always wanted to kill people in OTHER places. They never really “got” me. Ooo! I should tell that at a Moth StorySLAM.[category=host]^Isn’t it weird that no matter how hard we try we all eventually turn into our parents? Or we end up wearing their clothes and killing in their name. I think you get what I’m saying.[category=host]^Did you know this hotel was built on top of a graveyard but the bodies were never moved? My great great grandparents insisted on it. You know, like buying a house and keeping the couch.[category=host]^This hotel hasn’t been updated much since I was a kid. Same carpet. A lot of the same bloodstains. Ahh, it really brings me back. [category=host]^Being in this hotel makes me feel like a kid again. A kid that kills people, but hey every family has its quirks. [category=host]^My mother used to say “all of this will be yours someday.” She was referring to the hotel AND her insatiable thirst for blood.[category=host]^Being raised in this murder hotel wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Sure, there was a pool but there were a lot of corpses in it.[category=host]^When I was a kid, I used to ride this elevator up and down all day. It probably would have annoyed the guests if they’d lived long enough to notice. Haha, they were dead. [category=host]^You know, I respect my parents for balancing their serial murder and hotel management careers and still finding time to horribly scar my psyche. Oh, this is our stop. [category=host]^When I was a kid this hotel seemed SO big and murder seemed SO wrong! It’s funny how things change when you get older. [category=host]^You know, I avoided this place most of my adult life but it’s surprisingly nice to be back. To you this is just a haunted murder hotel, but to me it’s a haunted murder HOME.[category=host] ^Weird, this hotel looks exactly the same as when I was a kid. The wallpaper’s the same, the lights haven’t been replaced and there’s still an elevator full of terrified people.[category=host]^I had some good times growing up in this terrifying hotel. I would kill to feel like that kid again...which is sort of the whole premise for this game I guess.[category=host]^How can I run a hotel, be a good son, and murder daily? Somehow I make it work! [category=host]^Remember the book Eloise, about a little girl living in a hotel, causing mischief? I’m like her, but with more murder. [category=host]^It would break my mother’s heart to think I checked you into this hotel and then didn’t murder you. So this one’s for you Mother.[category=host]^There’s nothing more satisfying than carrying on your family’s legacy of murdering people in hotels. It’s also satisfying to wake up one minute BEFORE your alarm.[category=host]^I never thought I’d be back here, running the old family murder hotel.  I also thought I’d never own a pair of Crocs, but the blood just washes off so easily! [category=host]^My family used to make a killing running this old hotel, and I’m here to make sure that killing never ends.[category=host]^This hotel\\'s been in my family for generations, and it’s amazing to think about how many generations of guests have been murdered here.  Okay, this is our stop. [category=host]^When I was a kid, this elevator was operated by a kindly old man named Stan. Great guy. Almost makes me wish I didn’t push him down that empty shaft. [category=host]^Maybe I should renovate this hotel. It’s got great bones. And some complete skeletons! [category=host]^Moving back into my parents\\' old murder hotel is just a temporary thing until I figure out the next step in my career. I\\'m not gonna turn into them. [category=host]^My parents always discouraged my desire to become famous. They said that\\'s how serial killers get caught. They never really \\\"got\\\" me, you know? [category=host]^After I ran away from home to pursue my dream of being a game show host, I promised myself I\\'d never come back. But here I am. You know what? This\\'ll make a great chapter in my eventual memoir. Let me write it down. [category=host]^I wonder if Pat Sajak ever had to move back into his parents\\' house? The path to stardom is not always a straight line, you know. I saw that on a Target pillow once. [category=host]^My family never liked game shows. They always told me if I didn\\'t want to run the hotel, then I should be a dentist... that murders people... or an accountant... that murders people. But I always wanted to be a star. [category=host]^Someday I\\'m gonna be famous. Even if it\\'s just on the internet. [category=host]^My family never really understood me. But friends are the family you choose. And someday I\\'m gonna make the whole world my friend. [category=host]^Have you ever noticed how horror sequels are always trying to shoehorn in a bunch of new backstory about the killer\\'s life? Uh, yeah, NO THANK YOU. [category=host]^Everyone in my family is gone now. But I\\'m starting to think of YOU as my new family. So, that probably won\\'t go well for you. [category=host]^Normally I’d take a moment to point out that the winner of the game could be the Audience, but looking at these scores, uh yeah that doesn\\'t look likely.[category=host]^Oof. Look at that Audience. Not doing great. Do better.[category=host]^If you had to guess, do you think EVERYONE playing the Audience right now is a total dum-dum? Or are there like two or three smart people in there fighting against a tide of wrong answers. Huh, we may never know.[category=host]^Hey Audience, you’re blowing it. Try to be smarter, okay?! This is tough to watch.[category=host]^That’s weird. It looks like the Audience is winning. It could be because the actual players are so lackluster. Oops! Did I say that out loud?[category=host]^The Audience is currently in the lead. You go Audience! Embarrass the actual players![category=host]^Hmm. The Audience could win this. And then YOU all die, which would be pretty cool if you ask me.[category=host]^Most audiences are full of stupid people, but this Audience has a real chance of winning. Finger crossed![category=host]^Hey Audience, good luck out there.[category=host]^Hey Audience, I hope you all die in my game![category=host]^Hey Audience, I hope you all die too!! [category=host]^Oh… by the way.. the Audience is a player now and could win the whole frickin’ game.[category=host]^Oh… also… there’s an Audience in the game. If they survive, you die.[category=host]^Only one of you can survive this game… and who knows? Maybe it’ll be the Audience.[category=host]^Who will win? Who will die? Maybe the Audience.[category=host]^Hot tip! You can join the Audience at any time.[category=host]^If you‘re not ready now, you can join the Audience whenever.

Right next to...\\n^... unfortunately, we’ve got a pretty crappy game going on.^... but that’s not saying much.^... too bad none of the scores are above zero.^... if you count having a score below zero as winning.^... although I wouldn’t go bragging about it.^... even with an embarrassing score.^Screw Player Picked^That win was alright, Player 4. Just kinda middle-of-the-road, average, dull, run-of-the-mill “alright.” Honestly, if you were playing a more challenging game, like Risk or something, I don’t think you would have done that well, so take what you can.  That includes this...\\n^Player Four, that win was like a limp handshake. Next time you meet somebody, give them a firm grip, look them straight in the eye and say…\\n^Damn, Player Four, I was really looking forward to a big win. What the hell was this? Were you trying to be polite or something? You know what “polite” gets you in this game? Here…\\n^Yeah, ok, so you won, Player Four. But it’s not like you went for the jugular or anything. You really need to hone your competitive spirit. Show no mercy, take no prisoners, that kinda thing. This was more like, (wimpy voice) “oh, I’ll beat you but only if you’re ok with that I don’t wanna offend anyone will you still be my friend?” What you really should have been saying was...\\n^First up...^Let’s begin with...^To get started...^First...^Right off the bat...^Right off the top...^To begin with...^Let’s start with...^First question...^To get things started...^First on the docket...^To get things rolling...^Kicking things off...^Welcome to the Attack.^Brace yourself for the Attack.^Step right up to the Jack Attack.^Ask now for whom the screw tolls, Player Three.^Player Three, looks like that screw is all yours.^Can’t get rid of that screw so easily, Player Three.^Sorry, Player Three, the screw had other plans.^Player Three, now *you’re* screwed.^ShortieAsk1^ShortieAsk2^ShortieAsk3^ShortieAsk4^ShortieAsk5^Player 1, you put player two in their place, now let me put you in your place…\\n^Player 1, you’ve got this trivia thing down pat, you need to get out more… here’s a great pick-up line I learned…\\n^Player 1, you chewed up player two in that game… now spit them out quick so you can say…\\n^Player 1, you didn’t even break a sweat on that one, but don’t let that stop you from using deodorant, cuz I may not know a lot about hygiene, but…\\n^If you two just wanna watch tv, that’s cool. In the meantime…^Neither of you even wanted to try to answer? Shameful. You shoulda guessed this...^Neither of you even had a guess? I find that hard to believe. Well, believe this…^Two players and not one guess between you. It’s the new math. This would’ve been nice…^You mean to tell me that neither one of you players thought to pick this…^Player Four, please don’t go around bragging about your win, ok? You ended up with zero. You did as well as if you had spent the entire game in a coma. Wait. Wait! Player 4’s lips are moving. I can barely make out the words…\\n^Player One, time’s running out! ^Player One, watch the time!^Player One, watch the clock!^Player One, not much time left!^Player One, pick it up!^... cuz now I gotta do this.^... cuz it usually feels better when someone else is involved.^...

I like that, y’know why?  I need stability in my life, Player 3, and you, why you’re a rock.  You’re about as bright as one anyway.  There’s one other reason as well…\\n^Way to go, Player 2!  Players 1 & 3 may never show their faces in public again!  Speaking of public disgrace, let me remind you…\\n^Player 2, you came out way ahead in that game.  Player 1 and Player 3, you both need to pull your head out.  That way you’ll be able to fully appreciate it when I say…\\n^Player 2 you made winning look easy…course players 1 & 3 you made losing look easy, so they deserve some of the credit…and you all deserve to know that…\\n^It’s Player Two!^Player 2 has it!\\n^Player 2 is our winner!\\n^... we don’t want ‘em getting rusty.^... I didn’t hand ‘em out for my health.^... you’re being too nice.^... you didn’t come here to make friends.^... you wanna win, don’t you?^Player One, congratulations. Out of all four players, your score sucked the least. That is to say… it sucks, but you didn’t piss me off as much as those other three players. NOBODY BROKE ZERO!! Go play Chutes and Ladders, ok?\\n^Player One, you are our winner and by winner I mean “loser.” You didn’t even have a positive final score! I hope you four had fun cuz as far as I’m concerned this was a complete waste of time.\\n^Y’know what sucks, Player One? The fact that I have to declare you the winner even though you have a negative score. Players 2, 3 and 4, you know what *really* sucks? That’s right: the three of you. I want each of you to keep telling youselves…\\n^... keep an eye out for the wrong answer of the game. It’s still out there.^... our wrong answer of the game is still out there waiting to be picked.^... the wrong answer of the game is still there for the taking.^... big cash prizes can be yours if you find the wrong answer of the game.^... the wrong answer of the game is still out there waiting for you.^Player 2, I’m not exactly sure how  you won that game cuz from the looks of your score you played blindfolded. But I do know this.\\n^Hey Player 2!  I got news for you.  If you were trying to lose, you can’t even do that well.  Here’s another late-breaking news item…\\n^End loop^Player 1, you left those other three players in the dirt. I mean, check it out: They’re filthy. Hit the showers, folks, and while you’re in there, sing a few verses of…\\n^Player One, you ate those other three for breakfast. Along with juice, toast, milk and fruit you end up with…\\n^Very nice score, Player One. It’s got a nice shiny coat, strong teeth and its nose is cold. You should call it…\\n^Player three, did you win? It’s hard for me to tell since your lead is so marginal. Oh, yeah, I guess it is the best score out of the four. Ok, then: you won. Great. Congratulations. You still can’t deny that…\\n^Player three, you barely won that game. You musta been sweating. I can tell cuz there are huge stains under your breasts and you’re starting to stink. Here’s something that should freshen you right up…\\n^Player three, was that the best you could do? I mean, sure you won, but barely. You’re gonna need to put forth a little more effort next time. That’s the only way to stop me from saying…\\n^Y’know, I expected a nice win like this from you, Player 4. I could just tell by the way you carry yourself… your fashionable style, your superior hygiene, your generous spirit… all indicate that you’re a complete trivia dork. That’s right. Say it with me...\\n^Congratulations, Player Four. I’m hoping that win will help build your confidence a bit so that you don’t spend the rest of your days standing in a dark corner, rocking back and forth whispering…\\n^Very nice win, Player Four. You did a great job. However, I’m completely open to the possibility that the others let you win because of your propensity to fall into a deep dark depression whenever you lose at something. I gotta tell ya, it gets to be a real drag. Sometimes I just wanna say...\\n^You won that game quite nicely, Player Four. No question about it. Well, actually, there are a couple of oustanding questions. Like, was that you who farted around question five? And do you know you do this little leg kick thing every time you get a question right? And finally, did you know...\\n^When you see two clues that match...^, Player Three, where’s that screw going?^Player Three, who gets your screw?^OH Player Three, who’s getting the screw-job? -TG^Jack Attack Intro^Box 6 Rim Shot^Blip Blop^Boing^Duck^Horn Bonk^Dis Or Dat Cutoff^... and, check it out, Players 1 and 3 are all tied up...^... and believe it or not, Players 1 and 3 are in a tie...^... and, what have we here, a tie between Players 1 and 3...^Player 1, you really taught those other two a lesson today, didn’tcha?  Now if you could just explain what they’re doing hanging out with you I’d be really impressed.  In the meantime, keep telling yourself…\\n^Player One, you really humiliated those two!  Hope they don’t take it out on you after the game!  Remember, you can run & you can hide, but…\\n^Amazing, player 1, gloating is totally allowed on this one.  Cause all the gloating in the world won’t change the fact that…\\n^I gotta tell ya: A three-way tie is truly amazing! I’m just sorry that other player couldn’t hold up their end of the bargain. (to them:) DID YOU SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING? DID YOU EVEN TRY TO KEEP UP? What a disappointment. Now you’re going to have this ringing in your ears for all eternity...\\n^...if it’s both...^... and if you think it’s both...^And let’s see some screwin’ out there...^And don’t forget about your screws...^And don’t be afraid to use those screws...^And I wanna see some screwing...^And remember, you got those screws sitting there...^... Lock in *your* answer *before* Player One, because if Player One gets it *wrong* and *you* get it *right* you steal the cash.^... Choose your answer *before* Player One, and if Player One gets it *wrong* and *you* get it *right* that cash is yours.^Hey, player 2, looks like you came out with a fairly sound victory.  Now listen to this sound…\\n^Player 2, you may have posted a mark in the win column, but when you take a look at the overall stats, one thing becomes clear…\\n^Player 2, this victory is just like a night of drinking: fun while it lasted, but you’re still going home alone and you  won’t remember a thing about it tomorrow…try to remember this… ^Player 2, this victory was very inspirational. It makes me believe that even the biggest, stupidest moron can one day win a trivia game. Hold you head high, Player 2, and listen closely… ^... and we’ve got a three-way tie. Are your skulls fused together or something?^... and, unbelievably, we have a three-way tie! Alert the media.^... and it looks like... yep... we have ourselves a three-way tie. You guys are up to something, aren’t you?^Ask Cutoff^Hey, Player Four, y’know what it’s like to win a game with a negative score? It’s like making out with your cousin. Your cousin who’s been dead for six months. And all your other relatives are standing around you, pointing at you in shock and horror, screaming...\\n^Player Four, did you aspire to win with a negative score? Was that something you were shooting for? Did you you start you day saying “Gee, I hope I can do something really underwhelming and embarrassing today”? Or is this just par for the course for you? Maybe tomorrow you should tell yourself...\\n^Not too shabby, player 1. Hold your head up. (beat) No, really, hold your head up. I think your nose is bleeding. Now gently pinch the bridge of your nose. Now say…\\n^Player one, that was a sweet little win. I know because I licked it. (creepy:) That’s right. You heard me. I licked it. And then, right in its ear, I whispered…\\n^Player One, that was a nice win. Give yourself a pat on the back.If you can’t reach just ask one of those other three losers to do it for you. Hey, you guys? Guess what?\\n^Player Two, I don’t have good news.^Player Two, your screw didn’t work out quite right.^Player Two, this screw does not have a happy ending.^Hate to break the news to you, Player Two.^Player Two, that was your screw, wasn’t it?^Player Two, you’re screwed. You’ve got five seconds to pick an answer.^Player Two, you’ve been screwed. You’ve got five seconds.^The screw is in you, Player Two. Five seconds to make a choice.^That’ll net you an extra grand.^That earned you an extra grand.^That just earned you an extra thousand bucks.^You just picked up an extra thousand bucks for that.^That earned you an extra thousand dollars.^Player 1, I guess a win is a win no matter how you slice it… and you sliced it pretty damn thin - so I leave you with these words…\\n^Player 1, you won by a nosehair.  Good thing you never used that nose hair clipper you got for your birthday last year.  Either way you can breathe a lot easier knowing…\\n^Player 1, that was pretty close, but I just want to say that I never had any doubt that you were going to win. I mean, have you *seen* the other players? Total losers. Stand tall, Player One. Stand tall and shout to the heavens…\\n^Just me and you? That’s just how I like it.^Playing alone, are we? Don’t worry, I’m here.^All by yourself? Wouldn’t be the first time.^I see you’re all alone. Try not to be frightened.^Playing alone, I see. What else is new.^Couldn’t get anyone to join you, huh? I know how you feel.^Flying solo? So did Amelia Aerhart. Look how that turned out.^I’m glad it’s just you and me. I’m feeling a little needy.^I’m glad it’s just you and me. This way I can give you my full attention.^(over his shoulder)You tellin’ me I came all this way for a one player game?^Playing by yourself? Well, at least you won’t come in second.^Just me and you? That’s good. Now we can talk REAL LOUD. ^I’d say it was sad that you’re playing alone, but you already know that.^Did you *want* to play alone or did you get stood up again?^One player. Alright. This is gonna be a... party.^Oh, god, you’re by yourself? Please don’t tell anyone I was here.^A single player game, I see. Thanks for making us go through all the effort.^Oh, good, you’re all alone. I was just about to do some laundry. This’ll be much more fun.^Nobody wanted to play with you, huh. It’s like grammar school all over again.^Couldn’t find a partner? Gee, it’s kinda like a metaphor. (Do you know what that means?)^Listen, don’t worry: I find that *most* people enjoy playing alone.^No friends, huh? What’d you just get out of prison?^It’s just the two of us? Please don’t kill me.^Will you be my facebook friend?^Just you? Great. Looks like I“ll have to do all the heavy lifting.^You know what I love more than anything?

That’s pretty lame. You shoulda guessed this… ^Not even a stab in the dark? Who knows, you mighta picked this…^You could have at least tried. Hell, you might have even come up with this…^Apparently you’ve never heard of giving it “that old college try.” This would’ve been a nice choice…^Oh, hell. You should have at least tried. You might’ve even picked this…^GOODNESS, Player One, you’re screwed. You got five seconds to give me an answer.^You’re screwed, Player One. You’ve got five seconds.^Player One, you’ve been screwed. You’ve got five seconds to pick an answer.^Player 2, you ended up really close to the other three players. Your score, I mean. Not you personally. In fact, I get the distinct feeling that your opponents don’t actually like you that much. It’s true. Whenever you’re not around they say…\\n^I’d like to say that all four of you did very nicely. However, Player 2, did just a little bit nicely-er. Yep, Player 2 was the nice-liest. (the words are written that way only for clarity. It’s not a direction to read them as though you’re just thinking of them or stumbling over them. in fact, just the opposite: say those odd words as though you use them every day.) However, just so there’s no confusion...  \\n^Wow, Player 2, that was cutting it a little thin, don’t you think? Wouldn’t you have been more comfortable with a win that was thick? And meaty? And dripping with juices? Wait, that’s not a win. That’s a steak. With a side of…\\n^... and I am on the edge of my seat.^... but there’s more trivia to come.^... this could get interesting.^... who knows what might happen?^... but for how long?^... think that might change soon?^... at least for the moment.^... for the time being.^... let’s see if they stay there.^... but don’t go spending that money just yet.^... for now.^... but that could change mighty quick.^So Players 2 and 3, you ended up with less than zero and you lost.  That’s to be expected.  Player 1, what’s YOUR deal?  You’re gonna walk away with a victory with less than no points.  All you’ve proven is that…\\n^Gee, Player 1, you would have done better if you hadn’t played the game at all. Goes to show ya… (RE-RECORD. PREVIOUS VERSION DATED.)\\n^Wow, player 1, you actually won the game with a score that’s lower than zero.  That’s like running a race backwards, except that you don’t have to be in shape to play a trivia game.  By the way…^Player 2, aside from your victory, the other good news is that you and the other players are intellectually compatible.  When you’re done here why don’t you go stack some blocks.  Unless you think that’ll be too challenging. One other thing… ^Player 2, don’t  you dare gloat. Yes, you won… but your score has a minus sign in front of it. Then again, you never were very good at math. See if this adds up...^... and by quite a bit, I might add.^... and feeling pretty good right about now.^... with a comfortable cushion.^... and leaving no doubt about it, either.^... and with a nice little wad of cash to boot.^... and quite impressively, I might add.^Alright, let’s make history.^Ok, it’s time.^So, let’s get to it.^Alright, let’s do this thing.^Ok, what are we waiting for?^Ok, let’s get this show on the road.^Alright, let’s get this party started.^Alright, here we go.^And, right this way.^Ok, let’s light this sucker.^Hang on tight. We’re in for a ride.^Ok, no turning back.^So let’s make this happen.^And we’re off.^Alright, Here goes nothing.^And so it begins.^Alright, let’s move.^okey-doke.

Nothing spectacular, but hey, I’m sure your family’s proud of you.  Or at least they’ll SAY they’re proud of you, because they can’t tell you the harsh truths like this one…\\n^Player 3, as you bask in the warm glow of your victory, I’d like to remind you of the importance of good sportsmanship… in other games. Here gloating is accepted and, in fact, encouraged. Just like this… ^My god, Player 3, who would’ve thought a victory would be such a great sleep-inducer. Thank god, I’ve got some caffeine handy. And keep this handy for yourself…\\n^Player 3, you won! That was really… kinda… ok. But here’s something exciting for ya.\\n^Player two, how the hell did you come out on top but still be on the bottom? That’s quite a feat for somebody of your limited intelligence.\\n^Player Two, you’re like some freak of nature. You’re a winner who’s still a loser. They oughta put you in some carnival sideshow. The half-winner, half-loser! Don’t get too close, kids. Just gawk in amazement at its stunningly crappy score!\\n^Ok, something is clearly wrong when a player can win a game with a negative score. Player Two, you’ve destroyed my faith in humanity. If you had any honor you would not accept the title of winner. If you had any sense of what is just and proper, you would say...\\n^Add Money^Don’t you two make an adorable couple.^Ok, you two, try and keep your eyes off each other and on the questions.^You two are goin’ head to head, huh? Try not to hurt yourselves.^Well, look at this: we’ve got two of the greatest minds of the 21st century.^Hey, if you two lose interest in the game and start making out or something, pause the game so I can watch.^Haven’t I seen you two before, like on “Real Housewives of Kalamazoo” or something?^Hello, you two. Try not to make each other cry, ok?^Two Players? What happened. Did you lose your pieces to Battleship?^I’m very happy to be here with both of you. I’m on a lot of pain medication at the moment.^Hi there, you two. So which one of you is Rihanna and which one is Chris Brown? I’m sorry. Too soon?^Ok, I want you two to shake hands... harder...Harder...^So do you two know each other or has one of you been kidnapped?^Has anyone ever told you two you look alike?^(Cookie “shudders”) Excuse me, I just... I just had a very clear image of what your love-child would look like.^It’s funny, if I squint my eyes it looks like I’m watching a Presidential debate.^So are you two ready for some down and dirty trivia? Or would you rather just mud wrestle?^Ok, you two, by the end of this game you’re gonna be lean, fit and a whole hell of a lot smarter.^By the looks of you two, I’d say smart money is on the “under.”^I bet you two are going to find this game very challenging. Don’t ask me how I know.^Y’know, seeing the two of you there together makes me hopeful that one day we’ll have peace in the Middle East.^It’s nice to know you’ll both have a shoulder to cry on when you utterly fail at this game.^Ok, you two. I wanna fair fight. None of this (sfx: “punch/oof”) or this (sfx: “crash”) or this (sfx: “fart”)^One of you two needs a shower.^Ok, you two, let’s make this interesting: We’re gonna play to the death.^Listen up: the winner of this game gets to punch the other Player square in the face. Cool?^... and Players 3 and 4 are tied for the lead...^... and we’ve got a tie between Players 3 and 4...^... and Players 3 and 4 are all knotted up...^Nice job, Player 3, How does victory taste?  Salty? Crunchy? That may not be victory, that may just be a pretzel. While you figure it out, chew on this…^Let me tell you player 3, you made players 1 and 2 look like complete idiots in that game.  Unfortunately, for you, there’s a lotta that going around lately…^Player 3, that victory was like a work of art. Not like some classic masterpiece, more like a piece of contemporary art. Y’know, the kind where the artist prances around the room throwing feces at the wall shouting…^Player 3, fame is fleeting and so are victories.  One minute players 1 & 2 are humbled like the dogs they are, and the next they’re telling you…\\n^Player 3’s got it!^Player 3 takes the win!^Player 3 wins it all!^Player 2, you should be extremely proud of your victory ‘cuz I’m afraid that’s all you got goin’ for yourself.  Be proud of this, too…\\n^Player 2, chalk this one up in the win column, then take that piece of chalk and , in really big letters write…\\n^Player 2, this baby’s all yours.  I mean, look at it.  It’s got your eyes, your nose, your hair.  It even smiles when you say… (AUDIO SKIPS)\\n^Player 2, you’ve made me look at victory in a whole new light.  It’s sort of a murky and bleak light…but I can just make out these words…\\n^Uh, Player Three...^Uh oh, Player Three...^You don’t know Jack!\\n^So Player 1, Do you realize that what you’ve done is a mathematical impossibility?  There are  physicists working at NASA this very moment trying to figure out how the hell you won with no cash.

Thanks for the laughs. The rest of you...?\\n^Player Four, I gotta be honest, I expected you to crash and burn. I’m kinda shocked that you won. Granted it was pretty close, but looking at the four of you, you were definitely *not* the person I thought would win. And, y’know what? It takes a mighty big man to admit that he was wrong. No, no... there’s no need to thank me.\\n^Were you getting a little nervous there, Player Four? Perhaps you weren’t so confident you were gonna end up with the win on that one?

I’m talking about the kind of show where there’s a pole in the middle of the floor and they stuff dollar bills in your pants and scream…\\n^Player 2, you were in charge out there. But now the game is over and it’s time to get back to reality. How’s this for real…\\n^This wrong answer of the game is worth four thousand dollars. Congratulations.^This wrong answer of the game got you four thousand dollars. Nice job.^Today’s wrong answer of the game earns you four thousand bucks. Enjoy.^This wrong answer of the game has netted you an extra four thousand. Congratulations.^You’ll be happy to know this wrong answer of the game comes with four thousand dollars. Congrats.^This wrong answer of the game has earned you four thousand dollars. Don’t spend it all in one place.^Today’s wrong answer of the game is worth a tidy four thousand bucks. There ya go.^This wrong answer of the game just got you an extra four thousand smackers. Congratulations.^Player 2, you may have won the game, but you may have lost a couple friends.  No great loss.  Who’d want to hang out with a couple of losers who don’t know trivia?  Every time you walk down the street, people’d yell…\\n^Player 2, that was a nice win. You should be very proud. I mean, not *too* proud. Your competition was kinda lame. Let’s say just medium-proud. Y’know, not like you cured cancer proud. More like you just learned how to defrost a refrigerator kinda proud. And here’s something else you should learn... ^Player 2, great game, nice solid win.  To put things in perspective though, it’s just a trivia game, you’re still going to die someday, and… ^Player 2, very nice win. Now quickly, turn off the game and whatever you do - do not accept a rematch otherwise Players 1 and 3 may discover this was a total fluke. How do I know it was a fluke? Because… ^Player 2 you may have scored absolutely nothing, but you’re still a star in my book.  However, you should know that my book is very thin and has no point whatsoever.  I call it…\\n^Amazing. We got a room full of spineless wimps. Watch closely… ^C’mon, folks. This is supposed to be a “party” game. “Party”? Fun? Never mind. This would have been a good guess…^All that brain power out there and not one guess? Let’s not make this a habit. Here’s what you shoulda picked…^Dis or Dat Bonus Appear^...

Dirty dirty. Here are your socially acceptable names.^(Panteater) (Tom, don’t read the names in parentheses on these. Only read the names if it’s in the text after the parentheses. So just read this:) After my two favorite things. Pants and anteaters.^(Assbutt) Because you display the traits of both an ass and a butt.^(Dingus) Hey, if the Dingus fits...^(Chachi) You’re the second-most Chachi-looking person I’ve ever seen.^(Yeasty) You’ve got that yeasty look to you.^(Mary) Ready to play Mary? Okay Mary.^(Sack Lunch) Mmmm... sack lunch.^(Chucklenuts) Ready for some trivia, Chucklenuts?^(Frank N. Stein) (laughing) Frank. N. Stein! Get it! Frank. N. Stein!

It might be you someday, Dumpy.^(Toe Jelly) It’s like toe jam, but smoother.^(Lou Zer) Let’s give this a shot, Lou Zer!^Players 2 and 3...^Players 3 and 4. Uh, yeah. Your name choices have been sent off to the NSA. In the meantime, here are some new names.^Players 1, 2, and 3... our censors have voted to flog you, but I’ve talked them into giving you new names instead. THIS TIME.^Player 1, wash you mouth out with soap! Or this.^Players 2 and 3, that kind of language would get you kicked out of most games. Definitely out of most funerals.^Players 2, 3 and 4... we’re looking for names that aren’t x-rated or offensive. It limits you to just under 1 billion choices, I know, but try harder next time.^All y’all can’t enter a single allowable name? We have standards!^Players 1, 2, 3, and 4...^You think you’re real funny, don’t you. Fuck me ? (sfx: bleep) Fuck you! (sfx: bleep) I’m taking away $1000 bucks!^Players, 1, 3, and 4... you guys type like sailors! And not cute ones like George Clooney in The Perfect Storm. New names for the lot of you.^Players 1 and 3...^I see we have multiple Todds today. Or should I say Todd-day!^Look, there is simply no way there is more than one Neda playing this game, so I’m just going to go ahead and assume you’re all liars. Neda-related liars.^Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh. Either you guys are all me from another dimension or you’re just not being truthful with your names. And since I bet none of you know the secret password I use for my tea parties, I’m pretty sure you’re just Cookie imposters. But... feel free to stop by for tea anytime you want though, I could use the company. The password is “fidelio.”^Good god, we have a bunch of people in a huge a-s-d-f hurry. Well, don’t let me stand in your way. Let’s get the game started! Or as you people would say, “blfghartn!”^Uh, no. There is no way there are two Fards playing this game. I’ll assume you meant to type “Farts.” THAT I could believe. Okay, Farts, let’s move on.^Whoa whoa whoa, more than one Jesus? Oh this is going to require an entire rewrite of the big book. And by big book I mean the Where’s Waldo knock-off I’m writing, “Where’s Jesus?”^No, no, no, this isn’t right. There’s only one Deb Jacobs. THE Deb Jacobs. The love of my life, and all my past lives too. I really believe that.^Oh man, with all these Calders there is bound to be a major fire.^No, no, no, this is too many Travises. This is terrible. It’s a Travis-dy. (stifled laugh at your own joke) Travis-dy.^Wow, big surprise. Multiple Mikes. I’ll just try to hid emy shock that such an unusual name has shown multiple times in one game. Here this is me hiding my shock. (try to stifle a scream, then just scream) Ahhhhhhhhh! Sorry,just couldn’t hold in my shock.^Hmm. Very Harry in here. Good. Like I always say, no such thing as too Harry.^Wow, it’s a veritable Jen party here.  ^Hey Ryan. And Ryan. Ryan RyanRyanRyanRyanRyanRyan.^Ooh, Jacks going head to head! Can’t wait to see how this Jack Off turns out!^Oh man... which one is me REAL mother!?^Players 2 and 4...^Ok, telling me to fuck myself once is one thing but twice? Hey, guess what? Minus 50,000. No, you know what? Not enough. Minus 50,001. That’s how you’re starting. Minus 50,001.^Okay, look, I’m not just going to be repeated told to fuck (sfx: bleep) myself. You know what? You’re getting a goat. That’s it. Game’s over. Here’s a goat. Enjoy.^Players 2 and 4, you are disgusting, vile humans. May these new names cleanse your souls.^Well, don’t care about your name, huh?^No name. Okay, well, here you go.^Can’t play without a name. Federal regulations.^Alright then, I’ll just call you...^Nameless? So sad. I’ll help.^Well even if you don’t care, I do. I do.^Okay, nobody, you’re somebody now...^Have it your way.^Can’t be bothered? Okay, here.^Sure, I’ll pick a name for you.^Player 2, this is a family game, you fucker (sfx: bleep)! Try this.^Players 1 and 4...^Players 1 and 2...^Hey Todd! Just you and me old Todd! Todd, you and me are gonna Todd the hell out of this game!^Hi Neda! (Tom, Neda is Mike Bilder’s wife and it’s pronounced NED-uh)^Cookie. I see what you did there. I’ll take it as a compliment. Also I’ll be sending you a bill later for violating my trademarked name rights. But for now, I’ll take it as a  compliment.^“asdf.” You must be in a real hurry. Well, don’t let me stand in your way, let’s do this! # After this 15-second hum. (Tom, hum a note for 15 seconds, maybe stopping real quick to take a break in the middle but trying to make it sound like you didn’t take a breath)^Hey Fard! (Tom,  It’s pronounced fuh-ROD, two syllables - he’s our #1 superfan) Great to see our #1 fan playing today. Or as we call it, our urinating fan. # You don’t want to be our #2 fan.^Jesus. Thank god. I knew you would come.^(for typing in Deb Jacobs) Hi Deb!^Calder! How are you? You know, I know a guy named Calder. He set a kitchen on fire by overcooking microwave popcorn.^Hey Travis! How’s it going? How’s the family? And the dog? Good. Good.^Hi Mike! Love what you’ve done with the hair.^Hey Harry! Before we get started, you don’t need to poop, do you? This would be a good time to just get it out of the way. No? You’re ready? All right then.^Hi Jennifer! You made it, just like you said you would. You were always like that.^Hey! What’s up, Ryan? Hey, we can save this till after the game, but just a reminder that you owe me money.^Jack. Hmm... original. Where’d you think of that name? How could you have possibly come up with something so clever as Jack? Maybe you just started randomly putting letters together until you came up with the perfect random name? Anyway, it’s impressive, that kind of cleverness and ingenuity. Welcome, sir. You’re very welcome here.^Hi Mom!^Okay, potty mouth.^OKAY... that was totally unacceptable. Here.^Wow. Some people, am I right? ^Player 4, you French kiss your mom with that mouth? Here you go.^Players 3 and 4...^Player 3, I can’t accept such filth. Here.^Players 1 and 3... that’s Satan typing through your fingers. Satan. ^Players 1 and 4, just... vulgar. Too vulgar. This game is aired live in orphangaes.^Players 2, 3 and 4...^I’d like to extend a special welcome to Todd. Now don’t forget, Todd, you promised me a hundred bucks for agreeing to say the word Todd multiple times in one game opening.^Hi Neda! I hope you, Mike, Stella and Michael are doing well.   There’s no exercising in this game so feel free to sit down and relax. Unless you’re a different Neda. Then just regard everything I just said. (TOM: Neda is Mike Bilder’s wife and it’s pronounced NED-uh)^I see someone playing has the second best name in the world! Someday Cookie will unseat M. Night but until then, we’re pretty awesome, you and me, Cookie!^Oh look, we have an “asdf.” Looks like somebody’s too damn lazy to type in a name. You know,there are thousands of names that actually have fewer letters than asdf... Bob. Jan. Pat. Mo. Bo. Jo. R-period as in R Kelly. But whatever, (try to pronounce “asdf” as a word) Assdoeufff.  We’ll just savor all that time you saved by typing in Assdoeuff and thank you. Thank you for saving us all that time. Thank you, Assdoeuff. ^Wait, do I see... is that... Fard? (fuh-ROD) Hi Fard (fuh-ROD)! Look, I know it doesn’t seem fair for me to just call out one person, but come on. Fard is a longtime YDKJ fan and we love him. All it takes is 20 years of dedicated fandom and you too could get your name recognized in our game. Just... think about it. ^Oh man, Jesus, is this really necessary. It’s like, you obviously know all the answers. It’s just gloating. But, whatever. If you need your ego stroked this much, I’ll oblige, Jesus.^Hey, Deb Jacobs is here! Deb, how’s Ben!? Forget it, I know how he is, he’s fine. He says he loves you, and he’s sorry he doesn’t say it enough. And he’s really cut down on the murders. He’s a good boy.^Oh boy, Calder’s playing. HIDE THE MICROWAVE POPCORN!^Oh good, we have a Travis playing. It’s just one of my favorite names, Travis. Just seems like a guy you could hang out with, like at a barbecue or something. Or maybe like 7 or 8 barbecues, spaced every two weeks over the course of a couple of months. Anyway, welcome, Travis.^Always love it when a Mike shows up to play. Which is like, every other game, because it’s was like the most common man’s name for like, 50 years. But don’t worry Mike, you’re special. You’re one of the special ones. ^Hey! Harry’s here! I’m just going to assume this ISN’T the Harry from One Direction and just one of the other random Harrys out there like Harry Johnson or Harry Gottlieb or Harry and the Hendersons. But just in case it’s Harry from One Direction... (squeal like a little girl)!!!^Jennifer! How are you! I’ve been meaning to call, but I’ve just been soooo busy. Let’s chat after the game.^Oh man, I always hate when a Ryan shows up because it could be a male or female name, or a first name or a last name, or a donkey’s name, and I just don’t know what I’m working with. So for now to cover all the bases I’m just going to assume you’re a hermaphroditic donkey named Ryan Ryan.^Well, there it is. I’ve been waiting and waiting for someone to type in Jack as their name, and someone finally did it. After over 35 million plays of this game, someone finally typed in Jack as their name. It’s been a long wait, but we’ve been waiting for you. We have a celebratory sound effect that we’ve been saving up for all these years. Here you go Jack. (sfx: donkey) There you go. ^Oh good, mom’s here. Mom, I’ve been meaning to call you. I need some cash. Just to get me through next week. And a casserole. Any casserole would be good, I’m hungry. And my laundry is filthy. I’ll drop it off after the game. Oh, and I’m in a bit of legal trouble, well not really legal trouble, just something with a bookie. Hoping you can help with that. We’ll chat.^Time\\'s Running Out^Watch The Clock^Watch Your Time^Hello^Time\\'s a Wastin\\'^Time\\'s Almost Up^Not Much Time Left^Time is Short^Watch Your Clock^Watch The Time^If you think an opponent doesn’t know the answer, hit your Screw button and you’ll force them to answer immediately.

If you’d made it to six I was gonna put my pants on. [category=host]^Okay, five players. Well, I only brought ice cream for four. So, I’ll just throw it all away.  [category=host]^Okay, five people. That’s a good number for Fibbage or SOLVING A MYSTERY! Wait, I solved it last week. A chimp in a dumb waiter did it. [category=host]^Okay, five! It’s casual, yet qualifies as a gathering. Nice!
